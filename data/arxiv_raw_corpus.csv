10.48550/arXiv.2503.10620	From TOWER to SPIRE: Adding the Speech Modality to a Text-Only LLM	Kshitij Ambilduke, Ben Peters, Sonal Sannigrahi, Anil Keshwani, Tsz Kin Lam, Bruno Martins, Marcely Zanon Boito, André F.T. Martins	Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance and generalization capabilities across multiple languages and tasks, making them very attractive targets for multi-modality integration (e.g., images or speech). In this work, we extend an existing LLM to the speech modality via speech discretization and continued pre-training. In particular, we are interested in multilingual LLMs, such as TOWER, as their pre-training setting allows us to treat discretized speech input as an additional translation language. The resulting open-source model, SPIRE, is able to transcribe and translate English speech input while maintaining TOWER's original performance on translation-related tasks, showcasing that discretized speech input integration as an additional language is feasible during LLM adaptation. We make our code and models available to the community.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10617	Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning for Adaptive Large Language Models	Andy Zhou	Adapting large language models to multiple tasks can cause cross-skill interference, where improvements for one skill degrade another. While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10533	The Impact of Item-Writing Flaws on Difficulty and Discrimination in Item Response Theory	Robin Schmucker, Steven Moore	High-quality test items are essential for educational assessments, particularly within Item Response Theory (IRT). Traditional validation methods rely on resource-intensive pilot testing to estimate item difficulty and discrimination. More recently, Item-Writing Flaw (IWF) rubrics emerged as a domain-general approach for evaluating test items based on textual features. However, their relationship to IRT parameters remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a study involving over 7,000 multiple-choice questions across various STEM subjects (e.g., math and biology). Using an automated approach, we annotated each question with a 19-criteria IWF rubric and studied relationships to data-driven IRT parameters. Our analysis revealed statistically significant links between the number of IWFs and IRT difficulty and discrimination parameters, particularly in life and physical science domains. We further observed how specific IWF criteria can impact item quality more and less severely (e.g., negative wording vs. implausible distractors). Overall, while IWFs are useful for predicting IRT parameters--particularly for screening low-difficulty MCQs--they cannot replace traditional data-driven validation methods. Our findings highlight the need for further research on domain-general evaluation rubrics and algorithms that understand domain-specific content for robust item validation.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10515	Probing LLMs for Multilingual Discourse Generalization Through a Unified Label Set	Florian Eichin, Yang Janet Liu, Barbara Plank, Michael A. Hedderich	Discourse understanding is essential for many NLP tasks, yet most existing work remains constrained by framework-dependent discourse representations. This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) capture discourse knowledge that generalizes across languages and frameworks. We address this question along two dimensions: (1) developing a unified discourse relation label set to facilitate cross-lingual and cross-framework discourse analysis, and (2) probing LLMs to assess whether they encode generalizable discourse abstractions. Using multilingual discourse relation classification as a testbed, we examine a comprehensive set of 23 LLMs of varying sizes and multilingual capabilities. Our results show that LLMs, especially those with multilingual training corpora, can generalize discourse information across languages and frameworks. Further layer-wise analyses reveal that language generalization at the discourse level is most salient in the intermediate layers. Lastly, our error analysis provides an account of challenging relation classes.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10497	MMLU-ProX: A Multilingual Benchmark for Advanced Large Language Model Evaluation	Weihao Xuan, Rui Yang, Heli Qi, Qingcheng Zeng, Yunze Xiao, Yun Xing, Junjue Wang, Huitao Li, Xin Li, Kunyu Yu, Nan Liu, Qingyu Chen, Douglas Teodoro, Edison Marrese-Taylor, Shijian Lu, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo, Irene Li	Traditional benchmarks struggle to evaluate increasingly sophisticated language models in multilingual and culturally diverse contexts. To address this gap, we introduce MMLU-ProX, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark covering 13 typologically diverse languages with approximately 11,829 questions per language. Building on the challenging reasoning-focused design of MMLU-Pro, our framework employs a semi-automatic translation process: translations generated by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are rigorously evaluated by expert annotators to ensure conceptual accuracy, terminological consistency, and cultural relevance. We comprehensively evaluate 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using 5-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and zero-shot prompting strategies, analyzing their performance across linguistic and cultural boundaries. Our experiments reveal consistent performance degradation from high-resource languages to lower-resource ones, with the best models achieving over 70% accuracy on English but dropping to around 40% for languages like Swahili, highlighting persistent gaps in multilingual capabilities despite recent advances. MMLU-ProX is an ongoing project; we are expanding our benchmark by incorporating additional languages and evaluating more language models to provide a more comprehensive assessment of multilingual capabilities.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10494	Source-primed Multi-turn Conversation Helps Large Language Models Translate Documents	Hanxu Hu, Jannis Vamvas, Rico Sennrich	LLMs have paved the way for truly simple document-level machine translation, but challenges such as omission errors remain. In this paper, we study a simple method for handling document-level machine translation, by leveraging previous contexts in a multi-turn conversational manner. Specifically, by decomposing documents into segments and iteratively translating them while maintaining previous turns, this method ensures coherent translations without additional training, and can fully re-use the KV cache of previous turns thus minimizing computational overhead. We further propose a `source-primed' method that first provides the whole source document before multi-turn translation. We empirically show this multi-turn method outperforms both translating entire documents in a single turn and translating each segment independently according to multiple automatic metrics in representative LLMs, establishing a strong baseline for document-level translation using LLMs.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10486	LLMs in Disease Diagnosis: A Comparative Study of DeepSeek-R1 and O3 Mini Across Chronic Health Conditions	Gaurav Kumar Gupta, Pranal Pande	Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing medical diagnostics by enhancing both disease classification and clinical decision-making. In this study, we evaluate the performance of two LLM- based diagnostic tools, DeepSeek R1 and O3 Mini, using a structured dataset of symptoms and diagnoses. We assessed their predictive accuracy at both the disease and category levels, as well as the reliability of their confidence scores. DeepSeek R1 achieved a disease-level accuracy of 76% and an overall accuracy of 82%, outperforming O3 Mini, which attained 72% and 75% respectively. Notably, DeepSeek R1 demonstrated exceptional performance in Mental Health, Neurological Disorders, and Oncology, where it reached 100% accuracy, while O3 Mini excelled in Autoimmune Disease classification with 100% accuracy. Both models, however, struggled with Respiratory Disease classification, recording accuracies of only 40% for DeepSeek R1 and 20% for O3 Mini. Additionally, the analysis of confidence scores revealed that DeepSeek R1 provided high-confidence predictions in 92% of cases, compared to 68% for O3 Mini. Ethical considerations regarding bias, model interpretability, and data privacy are also discussed to ensure the responsible integration of LLMs into clinical practice. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLM-based diagnostic systems and provide a roadmap for future enhancements in AI-driven healthcare.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10480	World Modeling Makes a Better Planner: Dual Preference Optimization for Embodied Task Planning	Siyin Wang, Zhaoye Fei, Qinyuan Cheng, Shiduo Zhang, Panpan Cai, Jinlan Fu, Xipeng Qiu	Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown promise for embodied task planning, yet they struggle with fundamental challenges like dependency constraints and efficiency. Existing approaches either solely optimize action selection or leverage world models during inference, overlooking the benefits of learning to model the world as a way to enhance planning capabilities. We propose Dual Preference Optimization (D$^2$PO), a new learning framework that jointly optimizes state prediction and action selection through preference learning, enabling LVLMs to understand environment dynamics for better planning. To automatically collect trajectories and stepwise preference data without human annotation, we introduce a tree search mechanism for extensive exploration via trial-and-error. Extensive experiments on VoTa-Bench demonstrate that our D$^2$PO-based method significantly outperforms existing methods and GPT-4o when applied to Qwen2-VL (7B), LLaVA-1.6 (7B), and LLaMA-3.2 (11B), achieving superior task success rates with more efficient execution paths.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10470	Statistical Analysis of Sentence Structures through ASCII, Lexical Alignment and PCA	Abhijeet Sahdev	While utilizing syntactic tools such as parts-of-speech (POS) tagging has helped us understand sentence structures and their distribution across diverse corpora, it is quite complex and poses a challenge in natural language processing (NLP). This study focuses on understanding sentence structure balance - usages of nouns, verbs, determiners, etc - harmoniously without relying on such tools. It proposes a novel statistical method that uses American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) codes to represent text of 11 text corpora from various sources and their lexical category alignment after using their compressed versions through PCA, and analyzes the results through histograms and normality tests such as Shapiro-Wilk and Anderson-Darling Tests. By focusing on ASCII codes, this approach simplifies text processing, although not replacing any syntactic tools but complementing them by offering it as a resource-efficient tool for assessing text balance. The story generated by Grok shows near normality indicating balanced sentence structures in LLM outputs, whereas 4 out of the remaining 10 pass the normality tests. Further research could explore potential applications in text quality evaluation and style analysis with syntactic integration for more broader tasks.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10460	Light-R1: Curriculum SFT, DPO and RL for Long COT from Scratch and Beyond	Liang Wen, Yunke Cai, Fenrui Xiao, Xin He, Qi An, Zhenyu Duan, Yimin Du, Junchen Liu, Lifu Tang, Xiaowei Lv, Haosheng Zou, Yongchao Deng, Shousheng Jia, Xiangzheng Zhang	"This paper presents our work on the Light-R1 series, with models, data, and code all released.
We first focus on training long COT models from scratch, specifically starting from models initially lacking long COT capabilities. Using a curriculum training recipe consisting of two-stage SFT and semi-on-policy DPO, we train our model Light-R1-32B from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, resulting in superior math performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B. Despite being trained exclusively on math data, Light-R1-32B shows strong generalization across other domains. In the subsequent phase of this work, we highlight the significant benefit of the 3k dataset constructed for the second SFT stage on enhancing other models. By fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1-Distilled models using this dataset, we obtain new SOTA models in 7B and 14B, while the 32B model, Light-R1-32B-DS performed comparably to QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1.
Furthermore, we extend our work by applying reinforcement learning, specifically GRPO, on long-COT models to further improve reasoning performance. We successfully train our final Light-R1-14B-DS with RL, achieving SOTA performance among 14B parameter models in math. With AIME24 & 25 scores of 74.0 and 60.2 respectively, Light-R1-14B-DS surpasses even many 32B models and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Its RL training also exhibits well expected behavior, showing simultaneous increase in response length and reward score.
The Light-R1 series of work validates training long-COT models from scratch, showcases the art in SFT data and releases SOTA models from RL."	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10452	DynaCode: A Dynamic Complexity-Aware Code Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Code Generation	Wenhao Hu, Jinhao Duan, Chunchen Wei, Li Zhang, Yue Zhang, Kaidi Xu	The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved their performance in code generation tasks. However, existing code benchmarks remain static, consisting of fixed datasets with predefined problems. This makes them vulnerable to memorization during training, where LLMs recall specific test cases instead of generalizing to new problems, leading to data contamination and unreliable evaluation results. To address these issues, we introduce DynaCode, a dynamic, complexity-aware benchmark that overcomes the limitations of static datasets. DynaCode evaluates LLMs systematically using a complexity-aware metric, incorporating both code complexity and call-graph structures. DynaCode achieves large-scale diversity, generating up to 189 million unique nested code problems across four distinct levels of code complexity, referred to as units, and 16 types of call graphs. Results on 12 latest LLMs show an average performance drop of 16.8% to 45.7% compared to MBPP+, a static code generation benchmark, with performance progressively decreasing as complexity increases. This demonstrates DynaCode's ability to effectively differentiate LLMs. Additionally, by leveraging call graphs, we gain insights into LLM behavior, particularly their preference for handling subfunction interactions within nested code.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10427	VisTai: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for Traditional Chinese in Taiwan	Zhi Rui Tam, Ya-Ting Pai, Yen-Wei Lee	In this paper, we propose a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for Visual Language Models (VLM) in Traditional Chinese. Our evaluation suite, the first of its kind, contains two complementary components: (1) VisTai-MCQ, a collection of manually curated exam multi-choice questions from 21 academic subjects designed to test the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of VLMs; and (2) VisTai-Dialogue, an open dialogue benchmark comprising 131 image-question pairs manually created to evaluate VLMs' ability in free-form dialogue generation within Taiwanese cultural contexts. These benchmarks address a critical gap in the evaluation landscape, where existing benchmarks predominantly focus on English or Simplified Chinese, neglecting the unique linguistic and cultural aspects of Traditional Chinese used in regions like Taiwan and Hong Kong. Our analysis reveals significant performance differences across various VLMs and highlights specific challenges in processing Traditional Chinese visual content.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10367	G-Boost: Boosting Private SLMs with General LLMs	Yijiang Fan, Yuren Mao, Longbin Lai, Ying Zhang, Zhengping Qian, Yunjun Gao	Due to the limited computational resources, most Large Language Models (LLMs) developers can only fine-tune Small Language Models (SLMs) on their own data. These private SLMs typically have limited effectiveness. To boost the performance of private SLMs, this paper proposes to ask general LLMs for help. The general LLMs can be APIs or larger LLMs whose inference cost the developers can afford. Specifically, we propose the G-Boost framework where a private SLM adaptively performs collaborative inference with a general LLM under the guide of process reward. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can significantly boost the performance of private SLMs.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10357	Do I look like a `cat.n.01` to you? A Taxonomy Image Generation Benchmark	Viktor Moskvoretskii, Alina Lobanova, Ekaterina Neminova, Chris Biemann, Alexander Panchenko, Irina Nikishina	This paper explores the feasibility of using text-to-image models in a zero-shot setup to generate images for taxonomy concepts. While text-based methods for taxonomy enrichment are well-established, the potential of the visual dimension remains unexplored. To address this, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for Taxonomy Image Generation that assesses models' abilities to understand taxonomy concepts and generate relevant, high-quality images. The benchmark includes common-sense and randomly sampled WordNet concepts, alongside the LLM generated predictions. The 12 models are evaluated using 9 novel taxonomy-related text-to-image metrics and human feedback. Moreover, we pioneer the use of pairwise evaluation with GPT-4 feedback for image generation. Experimental results show that the ranking of models differs significantly from standard T2I tasks. Playground-v2 and FLUX consistently outperform across metrics and subsets and the retrieval-based approach performs poorly. These findings highlight the potential for automating the curation of structured data resources.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10354	A Hybrid Architecture with Efficient Fine Tuning for Abstractive Patent Document Summarization	Nevidu Jayatilleke, Ruvan Weerasinghe	Automatic patent summarization approaches that help in the patent analysis and comprehension procedure are in high demand due to the colossal growth of innovations. The development of natural language processing (NLP), text mining, and deep learning has notably amplified the efficacy of text summarization models for abundant types of documents. Summarizing patent text remains a pertinent challenge due to the labyrinthine writing style of these documents, which includes technical and legal intricacies. Additionally, these patent document contents are considerably lengthier than archetypal documents, which intricates the process of extracting pertinent information for summarization. Embodying extractive and abstractive text summarization methodologies into a hybrid framework, this study proposes a system for efficiently creating abstractive summaries of patent records. The procedure involves leveraging the LexRank graph-based algorithm to retrieve the important sentences from input parent texts, then utilizing a Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART) model that has been fine-tuned using Low-Ranking Adaptation (LoRA) for producing text summaries. This is accompanied by methodical testing and evaluation strategies. Furthermore, the author employed certain meta-learning techniques to achieve Domain Generalization (DG) of the abstractive component across multiple patent fields.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10351	New Trends for Modern Machine Translation with Large Reasoning Models	Sinuo Liu, Chenyang Lyu, Minghao Wu, Longyue Wang, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang	Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), particularly those leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT), have opened brand new possibility for Machine Translation (MT). This position paper argues that LRMs substantially transformed traditional neural MT as well as LLMs-based MT paradigms by reframing translation as a dynamic reasoning task that requires contextual, cultural, and linguistic understanding and reasoning. We identify three foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve ambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over cross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural intentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent, audience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can perform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential errors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better robustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation. We explore various scenarios in translation including stylized translation, document-level translation and multimodal translation by showcasing empirical examples that demonstrate the superiority of LRMs in translation. We also identify several interesting phenomenons for LRMs for MT including auto-pivot translation as well as the critical challenges such as over-localisation in translation and inference efficiency. In conclusion, we think that LRMs redefine translation systems not merely as text converters but as multilingual cognitive agents capable of reasoning about meaning beyond the text. This paradigm shift reminds us to think of problems in translation beyond traditional translation scenarios in a much broader context with LRMs - what we can achieve on top of it.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10337	KV-Distill: Nearly Lossless Learnable Context Compression for LLMs	Vivek Chari, Guanghui Qin, Benjamin Van Durme	Sequence-to-sequence tasks often benefit from long contexts, but the quadratic complexity of self-attention in standard Transformers renders this non-trivial. During generation, temporary representations -stored in the so-called KV cache-account for a large portion of GPU memory usage and scale linearly with context length. We introduce KV-Distill, a Transformer compression framework that distills long context KV caches into significantly shorter representations in a question-independent fashion. KV-Distill can be trained as a parameter-efficient adaptor for pretrained models, and enables the compression of arbitrary spans of a context while preserving pre-trained model capabilities. We treat a compressed-uncompressed cache as a student-teacher pairing and apply a KL-type divergence to match the generated outputs. KV-Distill outperforms other compression techniques in worst-case extractive tasks and approaches uncompressed performance in long context question answering and summarization, and it can be fine-tuned on domain-specific contexts to reduce lengths by up to 99% while preserving downstream performance. We demonstrate the generalizability of KV-Distill across various model sizes and architectures.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10298	Proceedings of the ISCA/ITG Workshop on Diversity in Large Speech and Language Models	Sebastian Möller, Pia Knoeferle, Britta Schulte, Nils Feldhus	Machine learning techniques have conquered many different tasks in speech and natural language processing, such as speech recognition, information extraction, text and speech generation, and human machine interaction using natural language or speech (chatbots). Modern techniques typically rely on large models for representing general knowledge of one or several languages (Large Language Models, LLMs), or for representing speech and general audio characteristics. These models have been trained with large amounts of speech and language data, typically including web content. When humans interact with such technologies, the effectiveness of the interaction will be influenced by how far humans make use of the same type of language the models have been trained on or, in other words, if the models are able to generalize to the language used by humans when interacting with the technology. This may lead to some gradual forms of adaptation in human speech and language production, and users who do not adapt may be excluded from efficient use of such technologies. On top of this, as commercial model development follows market needs, under-represented languages and dialects/sociolects may decrease in terms of priorities. Furthermore, for many lesser spoken languages the necessary data is not available, which will worsen a digital divide in speech and language technology usage. The workshop sets out to discuss this problem based on scientific contributions from the perspective of computer science and linguistics (including computational linguistics and NLP).

Text Classification as a Proxy for Analysing Wiki Deletion Discussions	Hsuvas Borkakoty, Luis Espinosa-Anke	Automated content moderation for collaborative knowledge hubs like Wikipedia or Wikidata is an important yet challenging task due to multiple factors. In this paper, we construct a database of discussions happening around articles marked for deletion in several Wikis and in three languages, which we then use to evaluate a range of LMs on different tasks (from predicting the outcome of the discussion to identifying the implicit policy an individual comment might be pointing to). Our results reveal, among others, that discussions leading to deletion are easier to predict, and that, surprisingly, self-produced tags (keep, delete or redirect) don't always help guiding the classifiers, presumably because of users' hesitation or deliberation within comments.

In this paper, we highlight these gaps with a real-world case study of an LLM-based chatbot deployed in a middle school setting, revealing how students used and sometimes misused the system. Building on these findings, we propose a new taxonomy of content-based risks for minors and introduce MinorBench, an open-source benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on their ability to refuse unsafe or inappropriate queries from children. We evaluate six prominent LLMs under different system prompts, demonstrating substantial variability in their child-safety compliance. Our results inform practical steps for more robust, child-focused safety mechanisms and underscore the urgency of tailoring AI systems to safeguard young users.

Automatic text summarization has emerged as a powerful tool to condense lengthy documents into concise and informative summaries. Depending on the approach used, text summarization can be categorized as either extractive or abstractive. While extractive methods are commonly used due to their simplicity, they often miss important information. On the other hand, Abstractive Summarization can generate more coherent and informative summaries by understanding the underlying meaning of the text. Abstractive techniques have gained attention in various languages, and recent advancements have been achieved through pre-training models such as BERT, BART, and T5. However, the challenge of summarizing long documents remains, and alternative models like Longformer have been introduced to address this limitation. In this context, this paper focuses on abstractive summarization in the Persian language. The authors introduce a new dataset of 300,000 full-text Persian papers obtained from the Ensani website and apply the ARMAN model, based on the Longformer architecture, to generate summaries. The experimental results demonstrate promising performance in Persian text summarization. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of related work, discusses the methodology, presents the experimental results, and concludes with future research directions.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10229	R.U.Psycho? Robust Unified Psychometric Testing of Language Models	Julian Schelb, Orr Borin, David Garcia, Andreas Spitz	Generative language models are increasingly being subjected to psychometric questionnaires intended for human testing, in efforts to establish their traits, as benchmarks for alignment, or to simulate participants in social science experiments. While this growing body of work sheds light on the likeness of model responses to those of humans, concerns are warranted regarding the rigour and reproducibility with which these experiments may be conducted. Instabilities in model outputs, sensitivity to prompt design, parameter settings, and a large number of available model versions increase documentation requirements. Consequently, generalization of findings is often complex and reproducibility is far from guaranteed. In this paper, we present this http URL, a framework for designing and running robust and reproducible psychometric experiments on generative language models that requires limited coding expertise. We demonstrate the capability of our framework on a variety of psychometric questionnaires, which lend support to prior findings in the literature. this http URL is available as a Python package at this https URL.

We explore the paradigmatic production in learner English by linking language functions to specific grammatical paradigms. Using the EFCAMDAT as a gold standard and a corpus of French learners as an external test set, we employ a supervised learning framework to operationalise and evaluate seven microsystems. We show that learner levels are associated with the seven microsystems (MS). Using ordinal regression modelling for evaluation, the results show that all MS are significant but yield a low impact if taken individually. However, their influence is shown to be impactful if taken as a group. These microsystems and their measurement method suggest that it is possible to use them as part of broader-purpose CALL systems focused on proficiency assessment.

Existing methods primarily focus on aligning inputs and outputs across modalities while overlooking deeper semantic alignment within model representations. To address this limitation, we propose an Adaptive Inner Speech-Text Alignment (AI-STA) method to bridge the modality gap by explicitly aligning speech and text representations at selected layers within LLMs. To achieve this, we leverage the optimal transport (OT) theory to quantify fine-grained representation discrepancies between speech and text. Furthermore, we utilize the cross-modal retrieval technique to identify the layers that are best suited for alignment and perform joint training on these layers. Experimental results on speech translation (ST) tasks demonstrate that AI-STA significantly improves the translation performance of large speech-text models (LSMs), outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of inner-layer speech-text alignment in LLMs and provide new insights into enhancing cross-modal learning.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10177	PRISM: Preference Refinement via Implicit Scene Modeling for 3D Vision-Language Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning	Yirong Sun, Yanjun Chen	We propose PRISM, a novel framework designed to overcome the limitations of 2D-based Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning (PBRL) by unifying 3D point cloud modeling and future-aware preference refinement. At its core, PRISM adopts a 3D Point Cloud-Language Model (3D-PC-LLM) to mitigate occlusion and viewpoint biases, ensuring more stable and spatially consistent preference signals. Additionally, PRISM leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to incorporate long-horizon considerations, thereby preventing the short-sighted feedback often seen in static preference comparisons. In contrast to conventional PBRL techniques, this integration of 3D perception and future-oriented reasoning leads to significant gains in preference agreement rates, faster policy convergence, and robust generalization across unseen robotic environments. Our empirical results, spanning tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation, highlight PRISM's potential for real-world applications where precise spatial understanding and reliable long-term decision-making are critical. By bridging 3D geometric awareness with CoT-driven preference modeling, PRISM establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable, human-aligned reinforcement learning.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10167	"""Well, Keep Thinking"": Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Adaptive Injection Decoding"	Hyunbin Jin, Je Won Yeom, Seunghyun Bae, Taesup Kim	Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. While effective, these methods require labor-intensive prompt engineering, raising the question of whether reasoning can be induced without reliance on explicit prompts. In this work, we unlock the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without explicit prompting. Inspired by zero-shot CoT and CoT-decoding, we propose a novel decoding strategy that systematically nudges LLMs to continue reasoning, thereby preventing immature reasoning processes. Specifically, we monitor the model's generation and inject a designated phrase whenever it is likely to conclude its response prematurely, before completing the reasoning process. Our experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed strategy substantially improves LLM reasoning capabilities, highlighting the potential of decoding-based interventions as an alternative to traditional prompting techniques.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10150	Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Hierarchical Knowledge	Haoyu Huang, Yongfeng Huang, Junjie Yang, Zhenyu Pan, Yongqiang Chen, Kaili Ma, Hongzhi Chen, James Cheng	Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks. However, existing RAG methods do not adequately utilize the naturally inherent hierarchical knowledge in human cognition, which limits the capabilities of RAG systems. In this paper, we introduce a new RAG approach, called HiRAG, which utilizes hierarchical knowledge to enhance the semantic understanding and structure capturing capabilities of RAG systems in the indexing and retrieval processes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HiRAG achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline methods. The code of our proposed method is available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10135	Gumiho: A Hybrid Architecture to Prioritize Early Tokens in Speculative Decoding	Jinze Li, Yixing Xu, Haiduo Huang, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Edith C.H. Ngai, Emad Barsoum	Speculative decoding (SPD) aims to accelerate the auto-regressive token generation process of a target Large Language Model (LLM). Some approaches employ a draft model with multiple heads to predict a sequence of future tokens, where each head handles a token in the sequence. The target LLM verifies the predicted sequence and accepts aligned tokens, enabling efficient multi-token generation. However, existing methods assume that all tokens within a sequence are equally important, employing identical head structures and relying on a single-generation paradigm, either serial or parallel. To this end, we theoretically demonstrate that initial tokens in the draft sequence are more important than later ones. Building on this insight, we propose Gumiho, a hybrid model combining serial and parallel heads. Specifically, given the critical importance of early tokens, we employ a sophisticated Transformer architecture for the early draft heads in a serial configuration to improve accuracy. For later tokens, we utilize multiple lightweight MLP heads operating in parallel to enhance efficiency. By allocating more advanced model structures and longer running times to the early heads, Gumiho achieves improved overall performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, fully validating its effectiveness.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10095	Cognitive-Mental-LLM: Leveraging Reasoning in Large Language Models for Mental Health Prediction via Online Text	Avinash Patil, Amardeep Kour Gedhu	Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in predicting mental health outcomes from online text, yet traditional classification methods often lack interpretability and robustness. This study evaluates structured reasoning techniques-Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency (SC-CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT)-to improve classification accuracy across multiple mental health datasets sourced from Reddit. We analyze reasoning-driven prompting strategies, including Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT, using key performance metrics such as Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Sensitivity/Specificity. Our findings indicate that reasoning-enhanced techniques improve classification performance over direct prediction, particularly in complex cases. Compared to baselines such as Zero Shot non-CoT Prompting, and fine-tuned pre-trained transformers such as BERT and Mental-RoBerta, and fine-tuned Open Source LLMs such as Mental Alpaca and Mental-Flan-T5, reasoning-driven LLMs yield notable gains on datasets like Dreaddit (+0.52\% over M-LLM, +0.82\% over BERT) and SDCNL (+4.67\% over M-LLM, +2.17\% over BERT). However, performance declines in Depression Severity, and CSSRS predictions suggest dataset-specific limitations, likely due to our using a more extensive test set. Among prompting strategies, Few-shot CoT consistently outperforms others, reinforcing the effectiveness of reasoning-driven LLMs. Nonetheless, dataset variability highlights challenges in model reliability and interpretability. This study provides a comprehensive benchmark of reasoning-based LLM techniques for mental health text classification. It offers insights into their potential for scalable clinical applications while identifying key challenges for future improvements.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
