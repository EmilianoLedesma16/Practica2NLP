10.48550/arXiv.2503.10620	From TOWER to SPIRE: Adding the Speech Modality to a Text-Only LLM	Kshitij Ambilduke, Ben Peters, Sonal Sannigrahi, Anil Keshwani, Tsz Kin Lam, Bruno Martins, Marcely Zanon Boito, André F.T. Martins	Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance and generalization capabilities across multiple languages and tasks, making them very attractive targets for multi-modality integration (e.g., images or speech). In this work, we extend an existing LLM to the speech modality via speech discretization and continued pre-training. In particular, we are interested in multilingual LLMs, such as TOWER, as their pre-training setting allows us to treat discretized speech input as an additional translation language. The resulting open-source model, SPIRE, is able to transcribe and translate English speech input while maintaining TOWER's original performance on translation-related tasks, showcasing that discretized speech input integration as an additional language is feasible during LLM adaptation. We make our code and models available to the community.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10617	Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning for Adaptive Large Language Models	Andy Zhou	Adapting large language models to multiple tasks can cause cross-skill interference, where improvements for one skill degrade another. While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10533	The Impact of Item-Writing Flaws on Difficulty and Discrimination in Item Response Theory	Robin Schmucker, Steven Moore	High-quality test items are essential for educational assessments, particularly within Item Response Theory (IRT). Traditional validation methods rely on resource-intensive pilot testing to estimate item difficulty and discrimination. More recently, Item-Writing Flaw (IWF) rubrics emerged as a domain-general approach for evaluating test items based on textual features. However, their relationship to IRT parameters remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a study involving over 7,000 multiple-choice questions across various STEM subjects (e.g., math and biology). Using an automated approach, we annotated each question with a 19-criteria IWF rubric and studied relationships to data-driven IRT parameters. Our analysis revealed statistically significant links between the number of IWFs and IRT difficulty and discrimination parameters, particularly in life and physical science domains. We further observed how specific IWF criteria can impact item quality more and less severely (e.g., negative wording vs. implausible distractors). Overall, while IWFs are useful for predicting IRT parameters--particularly for screening low-difficulty MCQs--they cannot replace traditional data-driven validation methods. Our findings highlight the need for further research on domain-general evaluation rubrics and algorithms that understand domain-specific content for robust item validation.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10515	Probing LLMs for Multilingual Discourse Generalization Through a Unified Label Set	Florian Eichin, Yang Janet Liu, Barbara Plank, Michael A. Hedderich	Discourse understanding is essential for many NLP tasks, yet most existing work remains constrained by framework-dependent discourse representations. This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) capture discourse knowledge that generalizes across languages and frameworks. We address this question along two dimensions: (1) developing a unified discourse relation label set to facilitate cross-lingual and cross-framework discourse analysis, and (2) probing LLMs to assess whether they encode generalizable discourse abstractions. Using multilingual discourse relation classification as a testbed, we examine a comprehensive set of 23 LLMs of varying sizes and multilingual capabilities. Our results show that LLMs, especially those with multilingual training corpora, can generalize discourse information across languages and frameworks. Further layer-wise analyses reveal that language generalization at the discourse level is most salient in the intermediate layers. Lastly, our error analysis provides an account of challenging relation classes.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10497	MMLU-ProX: A Multilingual Benchmark for Advanced Large Language Model Evaluation	Weihao Xuan, Rui Yang, Heli Qi, Qingcheng Zeng, Yunze Xiao, Yun Xing, Junjue Wang, Huitao Li, Xin Li, Kunyu Yu, Nan Liu, Qingyu Chen, Douglas Teodoro, Edison Marrese-Taylor, Shijian Lu, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo, Irene Li	Traditional benchmarks struggle to evaluate increasingly sophisticated language models in multilingual and culturally diverse contexts. To address this gap, we introduce MMLU-ProX, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark covering 13 typologically diverse languages with approximately 11,829 questions per language. Building on the challenging reasoning-focused design of MMLU-Pro, our framework employs a semi-automatic translation process: translations generated by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are rigorously evaluated by expert annotators to ensure conceptual accuracy, terminological consistency, and cultural relevance. We comprehensively evaluate 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using 5-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and zero-shot prompting strategies, analyzing their performance across linguistic and cultural boundaries. Our experiments reveal consistent performance degradation from high-resource languages to lower-resource ones, with the best models achieving over 70% accuracy on English but dropping to around 40% for languages like Swahili, highlighting persistent gaps in multilingual capabilities despite recent advances. MMLU-ProX is an ongoing project; we are expanding our benchmark by incorporating additional languages and evaluating more language models to provide a more comprehensive assessment of multilingual capabilities.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10494	Source-primed Multi-turn Conversation Helps Large Language Models Translate Documents	Hanxu Hu, Jannis Vamvas, Rico Sennrich	LLMs have paved the way for truly simple document-level machine translation, but challenges such as omission errors remain. In this paper, we study a simple method for handling document-level machine translation, by leveraging previous contexts in a multi-turn conversational manner. Specifically, by decomposing documents into segments and iteratively translating them while maintaining previous turns, this method ensures coherent translations without additional training, and can fully re-use the KV cache of previous turns thus minimizing computational overhead. We further propose a `source-primed' method that first provides the whole source document before multi-turn translation. We empirically show this multi-turn method outperforms both translating entire documents in a single turn and translating each segment independently according to multiple automatic metrics in representative LLMs, establishing a strong baseline for document-level translation using LLMs.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10486	LLMs in Disease Diagnosis: A Comparative Study of DeepSeek-R1 and O3 Mini Across Chronic Health Conditions	Gaurav Kumar Gupta, Pranal Pande	Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing medical diagnostics by enhancing both disease classification and clinical decision-making. In this study, we evaluate the performance of two LLM- based diagnostic tools, DeepSeek R1 and O3 Mini, using a structured dataset of symptoms and diagnoses. We assessed their predictive accuracy at both the disease and category levels, as well as the reliability of their confidence scores. DeepSeek R1 achieved a disease-level accuracy of 76% and an overall accuracy of 82%, outperforming O3 Mini, which attained 72% and 75% respectively. Notably, DeepSeek R1 demonstrated exceptional performance in Mental Health, Neurological Disorders, and Oncology, where it reached 100% accuracy, while O3 Mini excelled in Autoimmune Disease classification with 100% accuracy. Both models, however, struggled with Respiratory Disease classification, recording accuracies of only 40% for DeepSeek R1 and 20% for O3 Mini. Additionally, the analysis of confidence scores revealed that DeepSeek R1 provided high-confidence predictions in 92% of cases, compared to 68% for O3 Mini. Ethical considerations regarding bias, model interpretability, and data privacy are also discussed to ensure the responsible integration of LLMs into clinical practice. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLM-based diagnostic systems and provide a roadmap for future enhancements in AI-driven healthcare.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10480	World Modeling Makes a Better Planner: Dual Preference Optimization for Embodied Task Planning	Siyin Wang, Zhaoye Fei, Qinyuan Cheng, Shiduo Zhang, Panpan Cai, Jinlan Fu, Xipeng Qiu	Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown promise for embodied task planning, yet they struggle with fundamental challenges like dependency constraints and efficiency. Existing approaches either solely optimize action selection or leverage world models during inference, overlooking the benefits of learning to model the world as a way to enhance planning capabilities. We propose Dual Preference Optimization (D$^2$PO), a new learning framework that jointly optimizes state prediction and action selection through preference learning, enabling LVLMs to understand environment dynamics for better planning. To automatically collect trajectories and stepwise preference data without human annotation, we introduce a tree search mechanism for extensive exploration via trial-and-error. Extensive experiments on VoTa-Bench demonstrate that our D$^2$PO-based method significantly outperforms existing methods and GPT-4o when applied to Qwen2-VL (7B), LLaVA-1.6 (7B), and LLaMA-3.2 (11B), achieving superior task success rates with more efficient execution paths.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10470	Statistical Analysis of Sentence Structures through ASCII, Lexical Alignment and PCA	Abhijeet Sahdev	While utilizing syntactic tools such as parts-of-speech (POS) tagging has helped us understand sentence structures and their distribution across diverse corpora, it is quite complex and poses a challenge in natural language processing (NLP). This study focuses on understanding sentence structure balance - usages of nouns, verbs, determiners, etc - harmoniously without relying on such tools. It proposes a novel statistical method that uses American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) codes to represent text of 11 text corpora from various sources and their lexical category alignment after using their compressed versions through PCA, and analyzes the results through histograms and normality tests such as Shapiro-Wilk and Anderson-Darling Tests. By focusing on ASCII codes, this approach simplifies text processing, although not replacing any syntactic tools but complementing them by offering it as a resource-efficient tool for assessing text balance. The story generated by Grok shows near normality indicating balanced sentence structures in LLM outputs, whereas 4 out of the remaining 10 pass the normality tests. Further research could explore potential applications in text quality evaluation and style analysis with syntactic integration for more broader tasks.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10460	Light-R1: Curriculum SFT, DPO and RL for Long COT from Scratch and Beyond	Liang Wen, Yunke Cai, Fenrui Xiao, Xin He, Qi An, Zhenyu Duan, Yimin Du, Junchen Liu, Lifu Tang, Xiaowei Lv, Haosheng Zou, Yongchao Deng, Shousheng Jia, Xiangzheng Zhang	"This paper presents our work on the Light-R1 series, with models, data, and code all released.
We first focus on training long COT models from scratch, specifically starting from models initially lacking long COT capabilities. Using a curriculum training recipe consisting of two-stage SFT and semi-on-policy DPO, we train our model Light-R1-32B from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, resulting in superior math performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B. Despite being trained exclusively on math data, Light-R1-32B shows strong generalization across other domains. In the subsequent phase of this work, we highlight the significant benefit of the 3k dataset constructed for the second SFT stage on enhancing other models. By fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1-Distilled models using this dataset, we obtain new SOTA models in 7B and 14B, while the 32B model, Light-R1-32B-DS performed comparably to QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1.
Furthermore, we extend our work by applying reinforcement learning, specifically GRPO, on long-COT models to further improve reasoning performance. We successfully train our final Light-R1-14B-DS with RL, achieving SOTA performance among 14B parameter models in math. With AIME24 & 25 scores of 74.0 and 60.2 respectively, Light-R1-14B-DS surpasses even many 32B models and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Its RL training also exhibits well expected behavior, showing simultaneous increase in response length and reward score.
The Light-R1 series of work validates training long-COT models from scratch, showcases the art in SFT data and releases SOTA models from RL."	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10452	DynaCode: A Dynamic Complexity-Aware Code Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Code Generation	Wenhao Hu, Jinhao Duan, Chunchen Wei, Li Zhang, Yue Zhang, Kaidi Xu	The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved their performance in code generation tasks. However, existing code benchmarks remain static, consisting of fixed datasets with predefined problems. This makes them vulnerable to memorization during training, where LLMs recall specific test cases instead of generalizing to new problems, leading to data contamination and unreliable evaluation results. To address these issues, we introduce DynaCode, a dynamic, complexity-aware benchmark that overcomes the limitations of static datasets. DynaCode evaluates LLMs systematically using a complexity-aware metric, incorporating both code complexity and call-graph structures. DynaCode achieves large-scale diversity, generating up to 189 million unique nested code problems across four distinct levels of code complexity, referred to as units, and 16 types of call graphs. Results on 12 latest LLMs show an average performance drop of 16.8% to 45.7% compared to MBPP+, a static code generation benchmark, with performance progressively decreasing as complexity increases. This demonstrates DynaCode's ability to effectively differentiate LLMs. Additionally, by leveraging call graphs, we gain insights into LLM behavior, particularly their preference for handling subfunction interactions within nested code.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10427	VisTai: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for Traditional Chinese in Taiwan	Zhi Rui Tam, Ya-Ting Pai, Yen-Wei Lee	In this paper, we propose a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for Visual Language Models (VLM) in Traditional Chinese. Our evaluation suite, the first of its kind, contains two complementary components: (1) VisTai-MCQ, a collection of manually curated exam multi-choice questions from 21 academic subjects designed to test the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of VLMs; and (2) VisTai-Dialogue, an open dialogue benchmark comprising 131 image-question pairs manually created to evaluate VLMs' ability in free-form dialogue generation within Taiwanese cultural contexts. These benchmarks address a critical gap in the evaluation landscape, where existing benchmarks predominantly focus on English or Simplified Chinese, neglecting the unique linguistic and cultural aspects of Traditional Chinese used in regions like Taiwan and Hong Kong. Our analysis reveals significant performance differences across various VLMs and highlights specific challenges in processing Traditional Chinese visual content.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10367	G-Boost: Boosting Private SLMs with General LLMs	Yijiang Fan, Yuren Mao, Longbin Lai, Ying Zhang, Zhengping Qian, Yunjun Gao	Due to the limited computational resources, most Large Language Models (LLMs) developers can only fine-tune Small Language Models (SLMs) on their own data. These private SLMs typically have limited effectiveness. To boost the performance of private SLMs, this paper proposes to ask general LLMs for help. The general LLMs can be APIs or larger LLMs whose inference cost the developers can afford. Specifically, we propose the G-Boost framework where a private SLM adaptively performs collaborative inference with a general LLM under the guide of process reward. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can significantly boost the performance of private SLMs.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10357	Do I look like a `cat.n.01` to you? A Taxonomy Image Generation Benchmark	Viktor Moskvoretskii, Alina Lobanova, Ekaterina Neminova, Chris Biemann, Alexander Panchenko, Irina Nikishina	This paper explores the feasibility of using text-to-image models in a zero-shot setup to generate images for taxonomy concepts. While text-based methods for taxonomy enrichment are well-established, the potential of the visual dimension remains unexplored. To address this, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for Taxonomy Image Generation that assesses models' abilities to understand taxonomy concepts and generate relevant, high-quality images. The benchmark includes common-sense and randomly sampled WordNet concepts, alongside the LLM generated predictions. The 12 models are evaluated using 9 novel taxonomy-related text-to-image metrics and human feedback. Moreover, we pioneer the use of pairwise evaluation with GPT-4 feedback for image generation. Experimental results show that the ranking of models differs significantly from standard T2I tasks. Playground-v2 and FLUX consistently outperform across metrics and subsets and the retrieval-based approach performs poorly. These findings highlight the potential for automating the curation of structured data resources.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10354	A Hybrid Architecture with Efficient Fine Tuning for Abstractive Patent Document Summarization	Nevidu Jayatilleke, Ruvan Weerasinghe	Automatic patent summarization approaches that help in the patent analysis and comprehension procedure are in high demand due to the colossal growth of innovations. The development of natural language processing (NLP), text mining, and deep learning has notably amplified the efficacy of text summarization models for abundant types of documents. Summarizing patent text remains a pertinent challenge due to the labyrinthine writing style of these documents, which includes technical and legal intricacies. Additionally, these patent document contents are considerably lengthier than archetypal documents, which intricates the process of extracting pertinent information for summarization. Embodying extractive and abstractive text summarization methodologies into a hybrid framework, this study proposes a system for efficiently creating abstractive summaries of patent records. The procedure involves leveraging the LexRank graph-based algorithm to retrieve the important sentences from input parent texts, then utilizing a Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART) model that has been fine-tuned using Low-Ranking Adaptation (LoRA) for producing text summaries. This is accompanied by methodical testing and evaluation strategies. Furthermore, the author employed certain meta-learning techniques to achieve Domain Generalization (DG) of the abstractive component across multiple patent fields.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10351	New Trends for Modern Machine Translation with Large Reasoning Models	Sinuo Liu, Chenyang Lyu, Minghao Wu, Longyue Wang, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang	Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), particularly those leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT), have opened brand new possibility for Machine Translation (MT). This position paper argues that LRMs substantially transformed traditional neural MT as well as LLMs-based MT paradigms by reframing translation as a dynamic reasoning task that requires contextual, cultural, and linguistic understanding and reasoning. We identify three foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve ambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over cross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural intentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent, audience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can perform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential errors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better robustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation. We explore various scenarios in translation including stylized translation, document-level translation and multimodal translation by showcasing empirical examples that demonstrate the superiority of LRMs in translation. We also identify several interesting phenomenons for LRMs for MT including auto-pivot translation as well as the critical challenges such as over-localisation in translation and inference efficiency. In conclusion, we think that LRMs redefine translation systems not merely as text converters but as multilingual cognitive agents capable of reasoning about meaning beyond the text. This paradigm shift reminds us to think of problems in translation beyond traditional translation scenarios in a much broader context with LRMs - what we can achieve on top of it.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10337	KV-Distill: Nearly Lossless Learnable Context Compression for LLMs	Vivek Chari, Guanghui Qin, Benjamin Van Durme	Sequence-to-sequence tasks often benefit from long contexts, but the quadratic complexity of self-attention in standard Transformers renders this non-trivial. During generation, temporary representations -stored in the so-called KV cache-account for a large portion of GPU memory usage and scale linearly with context length. We introduce KV-Distill, a Transformer compression framework that distills long context KV caches into significantly shorter representations in a question-independent fashion. KV-Distill can be trained as a parameter-efficient adaptor for pretrained models, and enables the compression of arbitrary spans of a context while preserving pre-trained model capabilities. We treat a compressed-uncompressed cache as a student-teacher pairing and apply a KL-type divergence to match the generated outputs. KV-Distill outperforms other compression techniques in worst-case extractive tasks and approaches uncompressed performance in long context question answering and summarization, and it can be fine-tuned on domain-specific contexts to reduce lengths by up to 99% while preserving downstream performance. We demonstrate the generalizability of KV-Distill across various model sizes and architectures.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10298	Proceedings of the ISCA/ITG Workshop on Diversity in Large Speech and Language Models	Sebastian Möller, Pia Knoeferle, Britta Schulte, Nils Feldhus	Machine learning techniques have conquered many different tasks in speech and natural language processing, such as speech recognition, information extraction, text and speech generation, and human machine interaction using natural language or speech (chatbots). Modern techniques typically rely on large models for representing general knowledge of one or several languages (Large Language Models, LLMs), or for representing speech and general audio characteristics. These models have been trained with large amounts of speech and language data, typically including web content. When humans interact with such technologies, the effectiveness of the interaction will be influenced by how far humans make use of the same type of language the models have been trained on or, in other words, if the models are able to generalize to the language used by humans when interacting with the technology. This may lead to some gradual forms of adaptation in human speech and language production, and users who do not adapt may be excluded from efficient use of such technologies. On top of this, as commercial model development follows market needs, under-represented languages and dialects/sociolects may decrease in terms of priorities. Furthermore, for many lesser spoken languages the necessary data is not available, which will worsen a digital divide in speech and language technology usage. The workshop sets out to discuss this problem based on scientific contributions from the perspective of computer science and linguistics (including computational linguistics and NLP).

Text Classification as a Proxy for Analysing Wiki Deletion Discussions	Hsuvas Borkakoty, Luis Espinosa-Anke	Automated content moderation for collaborative knowledge hubs like Wikipedia or Wikidata is an important yet challenging task due to multiple factors. In this paper, we construct a database of discussions happening around articles marked for deletion in several Wikis and in three languages, which we then use to evaluate a range of LMs on different tasks (from predicting the outcome of the discussion to identifying the implicit policy an individual comment might be pointing to). Our results reveal, among others, that discussions leading to deletion are easier to predict, and that, surprisingly, self-produced tags (keep, delete or redirect) don't always help guiding the classifiers, presumably because of users' hesitation or deliberation within comments.

In this paper, we highlight these gaps with a real-world case study of an LLM-based chatbot deployed in a middle school setting, revealing how students used and sometimes misused the system. Building on these findings, we propose a new taxonomy of content-based risks for minors and introduce MinorBench, an open-source benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on their ability to refuse unsafe or inappropriate queries from children. We evaluate six prominent LLMs under different system prompts, demonstrating substantial variability in their child-safety compliance. Our results inform practical steps for more robust, child-focused safety mechanisms and underscore the urgency of tailoring AI systems to safeguard young users.

Automatic text summarization has emerged as a powerful tool to condense lengthy documents into concise and informative summaries. Depending on the approach used, text summarization can be categorized as either extractive or abstractive. While extractive methods are commonly used due to their simplicity, they often miss important information. On the other hand, Abstractive Summarization can generate more coherent and informative summaries by understanding the underlying meaning of the text. Abstractive techniques have gained attention in various languages, and recent advancements have been achieved through pre-training models such as BERT, BART, and T5. However, the challenge of summarizing long documents remains, and alternative models like Longformer have been introduced to address this limitation. In this context, this paper focuses on abstractive summarization in the Persian language. The authors introduce a new dataset of 300,000 full-text Persian papers obtained from the Ensani website and apply the ARMAN model, based on the Longformer architecture, to generate summaries. The experimental results demonstrate promising performance in Persian text summarization. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of related work, discusses the methodology, presents the experimental results, and concludes with future research directions.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10229	R.U.Psycho? Robust Unified Psychometric Testing of Language Models	Julian Schelb, Orr Borin, David Garcia, Andreas Spitz	Generative language models are increasingly being subjected to psychometric questionnaires intended for human testing, in efforts to establish their traits, as benchmarks for alignment, or to simulate participants in social science experiments. While this growing body of work sheds light on the likeness of model responses to those of humans, concerns are warranted regarding the rigour and reproducibility with which these experiments may be conducted. Instabilities in model outputs, sensitivity to prompt design, parameter settings, and a large number of available model versions increase documentation requirements. Consequently, generalization of findings is often complex and reproducibility is far from guaranteed. In this paper, we present this http URL, a framework for designing and running robust and reproducible psychometric experiments on generative language models that requires limited coding expertise. We demonstrate the capability of our framework on a variety of psychometric questionnaires, which lend support to prior findings in the literature. this http URL is available as a Python package at this https URL.

We explore the paradigmatic production in learner English by linking language functions to specific grammatical paradigms. Using the EFCAMDAT as a gold standard and a corpus of French learners as an external test set, we employ a supervised learning framework to operationalise and evaluate seven microsystems. We show that learner levels are associated with the seven microsystems (MS). Using ordinal regression modelling for evaluation, the results show that all MS are significant but yield a low impact if taken individually. However, their influence is shown to be impactful if taken as a group. These microsystems and their measurement method suggest that it is possible to use them as part of broader-purpose CALL systems focused on proficiency assessment.

Existing methods primarily focus on aligning inputs and outputs across modalities while overlooking deeper semantic alignment within model representations. To address this limitation, we propose an Adaptive Inner Speech-Text Alignment (AI-STA) method to bridge the modality gap by explicitly aligning speech and text representations at selected layers within LLMs. To achieve this, we leverage the optimal transport (OT) theory to quantify fine-grained representation discrepancies between speech and text. Furthermore, we utilize the cross-modal retrieval technique to identify the layers that are best suited for alignment and perform joint training on these layers. Experimental results on speech translation (ST) tasks demonstrate that AI-STA significantly improves the translation performance of large speech-text models (LSMs), outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of inner-layer speech-text alignment in LLMs and provide new insights into enhancing cross-modal learning.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10177	PRISM: Preference Refinement via Implicit Scene Modeling for 3D Vision-Language Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning	Yirong Sun, Yanjun Chen	We propose PRISM, a novel framework designed to overcome the limitations of 2D-based Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning (PBRL) by unifying 3D point cloud modeling and future-aware preference refinement. At its core, PRISM adopts a 3D Point Cloud-Language Model (3D-PC-LLM) to mitigate occlusion and viewpoint biases, ensuring more stable and spatially consistent preference signals. Additionally, PRISM leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to incorporate long-horizon considerations, thereby preventing the short-sighted feedback often seen in static preference comparisons. In contrast to conventional PBRL techniques, this integration of 3D perception and future-oriented reasoning leads to significant gains in preference agreement rates, faster policy convergence, and robust generalization across unseen robotic environments. Our empirical results, spanning tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation, highlight PRISM's potential for real-world applications where precise spatial understanding and reliable long-term decision-making are critical. By bridging 3D geometric awareness with CoT-driven preference modeling, PRISM establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable, human-aligned reinforcement learning.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10167	"""Well, Keep Thinking"": Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Adaptive Injection Decoding"	Hyunbin Jin, Je Won Yeom, Seunghyun Bae, Taesup Kim	Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. While effective, these methods require labor-intensive prompt engineering, raising the question of whether reasoning can be induced without reliance on explicit prompts. In this work, we unlock the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without explicit prompting. Inspired by zero-shot CoT and CoT-decoding, we propose a novel decoding strategy that systematically nudges LLMs to continue reasoning, thereby preventing immature reasoning processes. Specifically, we monitor the model's generation and inject a designated phrase whenever it is likely to conclude its response prematurely, before completing the reasoning process. Our experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed strategy substantially improves LLM reasoning capabilities, highlighting the potential of decoding-based interventions as an alternative to traditional prompting techniques.

However, existing RAG methods do not adequately utilize the naturally inherent hierarchical knowledge in human cognition, which limits the capabilities of RAG systems. In this paper, we introduce a new RAG approach, called HiRAG, which utilizes hierarchical knowledge to enhance the semantic understanding and structure capturing capabilities of RAG systems in the indexing and retrieval processes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HiRAG achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10135	Gumiho: A Hybrid Architecture to Prioritize Early Tokens in Speculative Decoding	Jinze Li, Yixing Xu, Haiduo Huang, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Edith C.H. Ngai, Emad Barsoum	Speculative decoding (SPD) aims to accelerate the auto-regressive token generation process of a target Large Language Model (LLM). Some approaches employ a draft model with multiple heads to predict a sequence of future tokens, where each head handles a token in the sequence. The target LLM verifies the predicted sequence and accepts aligned tokens, enabling efficient multi-token generation. However, existing methods assume that all tokens within a sequence are equally important, employing identical head structures and relying on a single-generation paradigm, either serial or parallel. To this end, we theoretically demonstrate that initial tokens in the draft sequence are more important than later ones. Building on this insight, we propose Gumiho, a hybrid model combining serial and parallel heads. Specifically, given the critical importance of early tokens, we employ a sophisticated Transformer architecture for the early draft heads in a serial configuration to improve accuracy. For later tokens, we utilize multiple lightweight MLP heads operating in parallel to enhance efficiency. By allocating more advanced model structures and longer running times to the early heads, Gumiho achieves improved overall performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, fully validating its effectiveness.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10095	Cognitive-Mental-LLM: Leveraging Reasoning in Large Language Models for Mental Health Prediction via Online Text	Avinash Patil, Amardeep Kour Gedhu	Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in predicting mental health outcomes from online text, yet traditional classification methods often lack interpretability and robustness. This study evaluates structured reasoning techniques-Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency (SC-CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT)-to improve classification accuracy across multiple mental health datasets sourced from Reddit. We analyze reasoning-driven prompting strategies, including Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT, using key performance metrics such as Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Sensitivity/Specificity. Our findings indicate that reasoning-enhanced techniques improve classification performance over direct prediction, particularly in complex cases. Compared to baselines such as Zero Shot non-CoT Prompting, and fine-tuned pre-trained transformers such as BERT and Mental-RoBerta, and fine-tuned Open Source LLMs such as Mental Alpaca and Mental-Flan-T5, reasoning-driven LLMs yield notable gains on datasets like Dreaddit (+0.52\% over M-LLM, +0.82\% over BERT) and SDCNL (+4.67\% over M-LLM, +2.17\% over BERT). However, performance declines in Depression Severity, and CSSRS predictions suggest dataset-specific limitations, likely due to our using a more extensive test set. Among prompting strategies, Few-shot CoT consistently outperforms others, reinforcing the effectiveness of reasoning-driven LLMs. Nonetheless, dataset variability highlights challenges in model reliability and interpretability. This study provides a comprehensive benchmark of reasoning-based LLM techniques for mental health text classification. It offers insights into their potential for scalable clinical applications while identifying key challenges for future improvements.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10093	Representation-based Reward Modeling for Efficient Safety Alignment of Large Language Model	Qiyuan Deng, Xuefeng Bai, Kehai Chen, Yaowei Wang, Liqiang Nie, Min Zhang	Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), encounter the challenge of distribution shift. Current approaches typically address this issue through online sampling from the target policy, which requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we hypothesize that during off-policy training, while the ranking order of output generated by policy changes, their overall distribution remains relatively stable. This stability allows the transformation of the sampling process from the target policy into a re-ranking of preference data. Building on this hypothesis, We propose a new framework that leverages the model's intrinsic safety judgment capability to extract reward signals, which are then used to calculate label confidence for preferences reordering. Extensive experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses the distribution shift issue, remarkably enhancing the safety performance while reducing about 300x computational overheads.

Theoretical Analysis of Prompt Space Complexity, its Interaction with Answer Space During CoT Reasoning with LLMs: A Recurrent Perspective	Xiang Zhang, Juntai Cao, Jiaqi Wei, Chenyu You, Dujian Ding	"Despite the remarkable successes of Large Language Models (LLMs), their fundamental Transformer architecture possesses inherent theoretical limitations that restrict their capability to handle reasoning tasks with increasing computational complexity. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a practical solution, supported by several theoretical studies. However, current CoT-based methods (including ToT, GoT, etc.) generally adopt a ""one-prompt-fits-all"" strategy, using fixed templates (e.g., ""think step by step"") across diverse reasoning tasks. This method forces models to navigate an extremely complex prompt space to identify effective reasoning paths. The current prompt designing research are also heavily relying on trial-and-error rather than theoretically informed guidance. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the complexity and interplay between two crucial spaces: the prompt space (the space of potential prompt structures) and the answer space (the space of reasoning solutions generated by LLMs) in CoT reasoning. We demonstrate how reliance on a single universal prompt (e.g. think step by step) can negatively impact the theoretical computability of LLMs, illustrating that prompt complexity directly influences the structure and effectiveness of the navigation in answer space. Our analysis highlights that sometimes human supervision is critical for efficiently navigating the prompt space. We theoretically and empirically show that task-specific prompting significantly outperforms unsupervised prompt generation, emphasizing the necessity of thoughtful human guidance in CoT prompting."

However, the evaluation mechanism itself may not be reliable. For developers of MLLMs, questions remain about which benchmark to use and whether the test results meet their requirements. Therefore, we propose a critical principle of Information Density, which examines how much insight a benchmark can provide for the development of MLLMs. We characterize it from four key dimensions: (1) Fallacy, (2) Difficulty, (3) Redundancy, (4) Diversity. Through a comprehensive analysis of more than 10,000 samples, we measured the information density of 19 MLLM benchmarks. Experiments show that using the latest benchmarks in testing can provide more insight compared to previous ones, but there is still room for improvement in their information density. We hope this principle can promote the development and application of future MLLM benchmarks. Project page: this https URL	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]

It has been established in previous research that infants may use statistical regularities in speech to learn word segmentation. The research of Goldwater et al., demonstrated that incorporating context in models improves their ability to learn word segmentation. We implemented two of their models, a unigram and bigram model, to examine how context can improve statistical word segmentation. The results are consistent with our hypothesis that the bigram model outperforms the unigram model at predicting word segmentation. Extending the work of Goldwater et al., we also explored basic ways to model how young children might use previously learned words to segment new utterances.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]

However, they mainly focus on classification and simple generation tasks, limiting their broader application to more complex generation tasks in practice. To address this gap, we investigate the impact of demonstrations on token representations within the practical alignment tasks. We find that the transformer embeds the task function learned from demonstrations into the separator token representation, which plays an important role in the generation of prior response tokens. Once the prior response tokens are determined, the demonstrations become this http URL by this finding, we propose an efficient Progressive In-Context Alignment (PICA) method consisting of two stages. In the first few-shot stage, the model generates several prior response tokens via standard ICL while concurrently extracting the ICL vector that stores the task function from the separator token representation. In the following zero-shot stage, this ICL vector guides the model to generate responses without further this http URL experiments demonstrate that our PICA not only surpasses vanilla ICL but also achieves comparable performance to other alignment tuning methods. The proposed training-free method reduces the time cost (e.g., 5.45+) with improved alignment performance (e.g., 6.57+). Consequently, our work highlights the application of ICL for alignment and calls for a deeper understanding of ICL for complex generations. The code will be available at this https URL.

Funnell, James Booker, Sze H M Lam, Ugan Reddy, Kawsar Noor, Richard JB Dobson, Astri M.V. Luoma, Hani J Marcus	Introduction: Timely care in a specialised neuro-intensive therapy unit (ITU) reduces mortality and hospital stays, with planned admissions being safer than unplanned ones. However, post-operative care decisions remain subjective. This study used artificial intelligence (AI), specifically natural language processing (NLP) to analyse electronic health records (EHRs) and predict ITU admissions for elective surgery patients. Methods: This study analysed the EHRs of elective neurosurgery patients from University College London Hospital (UCLH) using NLP. Patients were categorised into planned high dependency unit (HDU) or ITU admission; unplanned HDU or ITU admission; or ward / overnight recovery (ONR). The Medical Concept Annotation Tool (MedCAT) was used to identify SNOMED-CT concepts within the clinical notes. We then explored the utility of these identified concepts for a range of AI algorithms trained to predict ITU admission. Results: The CogStack-MedCAT NLP model, initially trained on hospital-wide EHRs, underwent two refinements: first with data from patients with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) and then with data from Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) patients, achieving a concept detection F1-score of 0.93. This refined model was then used to extract concepts from EHR notes of 2,268 eligible neurosurgical patients. We integrated the extracted concepts into AI models, including a decision tree model and a neural time-series model. Using the simpler decision tree model, we achieved a recall of 0.87 (CI 0.82 - 0.91) for ITU admissions, reducing the proportion of unplanned ITU cases missed by human experts from 36% to 4%. Conclusion: The NLP model, refined for accuracy, has proven its efficiency in extracting relevant concepts, providing a reliable basis for predictive AI models to use in clinically valid applications.

Materials and Methods: Experiment materials used in this study is provided by the 2011 i2b2 Natural Language Processing Challenge. The 2011 i2b2 challenge involves coreference resolution in medical documents. Concept mentions have been annotated in clinical texts, and the mentions that co-refer in each document are to be linked by coreference chains. Normally, there are two ways of constructing a system to automatically discover co-referent links. One is to manually build rules for co-reference resolution, and the other category of approaches is to use machine learning systems to learn automatically from training datasets and then perform the resolution task on testing datasets. Results: Experiments show the existing co-reference resolution systems are able to find some of the co-referent links, and our rule based system performs well finding the majority of the co-referent links. Our system achieved 89.6% overall performance on multiple medical datasets. Conclusion: The experiment results show that manually crafted rules based on observation of training data is a valid way to accomplish high performance in this coreference resolution task for the critical biomedical domain.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09894	What's In Your Field? Mapping Scientific Research with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models	Abhipsha Das, Nicholas Lourie, Siavash Golkar, Mariel Pettee	The scientific literature's exponential growth makes it increasingly challenging to navigate and synthesize knowledge across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for understanding scientific text, but they fail to capture detailed relationships across large bodies of work. Unstructured approaches, like retrieval augmented generation, can sift through such corpora to recall relevant facts; however, when millions of facts influence the answer, unstructured approaches become cost prohibitive. Structured representations offer a natural complement -- enabling systematic analysis across the whole corpus. Recent work enhances LLMs with unstructured or semistructured representations of scientific concepts; to complement this, we try extracting structured representations using LLMs. By combining LLMs' semantic understanding with a schema of scientific concepts, we prototype a system that answers precise questions about the literature as a whole. Our schema applies across scientific fields and we extract concepts from it using only 20 manually annotated abstracts. To demonstrate the system, we extract concepts from 30,000 papers on arXiv spanning astrophysics, fluid dynamics, and evolutionary biology. The resulting database highlights emerging trends and, by visualizing the knowledge graph, offers new ways to explore the ever-growing landscape of scientific knowledge.

Implicit MBTI and Gender Detection Using Artificial Intelligence	Kourosh Shahnazari, Seyed Moein Ayyoubzadeh	In personalized technology and psychological research, precisely detecting demographic features and personality traits from digital interactions becomes ever more important. This work investigates implicit categorization, inferring personality and gender variables directly from linguistic patterns in Telegram conversation data, while conventional personality prediction techniques mostly depend on explicitly self-reported labels. We refine a Transformer-based language model (RoBERTa) to capture complex linguistic cues indicative of personality traits and gender differences using a dataset comprising 138,866 messages from 1,602 users annotated with MBTI types and 195,016 messages from 2,598 users annotated with gender. Confidence levels help to greatly raise model accuracy to 86.16\%, hence proving RoBERTa's capacity to consistently identify implicit personality types from conversational text data. Our results highlight the usefulness of Transformer topologies for implicit personality and gender classification, hence stressing their efficiency and stressing important trade-offs between accuracy and coverage in realistic conversational environments. With regard to gender classification, the model obtained an accuracy of 74.4\%, therefore capturing gender-specific language patterns. Personality dimension analysis showed that people with introverted and intuitive preferences are especially more active in text-based interactions. This study emphasizes practical issues in balancing accuracy and data coverage as Transformer-based models show their efficiency in implicit personality and gender prediction tasks from conversational texts.

Niraula, Diwa Koirala	Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), which involves identifying entities like person, location, and organization names in text. LLMs are especially promising for low-resource languages due to their ability to learn from limited data. However, the performance of GenAI models for Nepali, a low-resource language, has not been thoroughly evaluated. This paper investigates the application of state-of-the-art LLMs for Nepali NER, conducting experiments with various prompting techniques to assess their effectiveness.

Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in reducing task complexity, our empirical analysis reveals that it does not fully resolve this limitation. Through controlled experiments, we identify poor recall of implicit facts as the primary cause of failure, which significantly hampers reasoning performance. Interestingly, we observe that the internal attention weights from the generated CoT tokens can effectively ground implicit facts, even when these facts are not explicitly recalled. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free algorithm, Attrieval, which leverages attention weights to retrieve relevant facts from the long context and incorporates them into the reasoning process. Additionally, we find that selecting context tokens from CoT tokens further improves performance. Our results demonstrate that Attrieval enhances long-context reasoning capability notably on both synthetic and real-world QA datasets with various models.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, Ferdinando Fioretto	Constraints are critical in text generation as LLM outputs are often unreliable when it comes to ensuring generated outputs adhere to user defined instruction or general safety guidelines. To address this gap, we present Constrained Discrete Diffusion (CDD), a novel method for enforcing constraints on natural language by integrating discrete diffusion models with differentiable optimization. Unlike conventional text generators, which often rely on post-hoc filtering or model retraining for controllable generation, we propose imposing constraints directly into the discrete diffusion sampling process. We illustrate how this technique can be applied to satisfy a variety of natural language constraints, including (i) toxicity mitigation by preventing harmful content from emerging, (ii) character and sequence level lexical constraints, and (iii) novel molecule sequence generation with specific property adherence. Experimental results show that our constraint-aware procedure achieves high fidelity in meeting these requirements while preserving fluency and semantic coherence, outperforming auto-regressive and existing discrete diffusion approaches.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Gromov-Wasserstein Scoring Model Merging (GW-SMM) method, which merges models based on feature distribution similarities measured via the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Our approach begins by extracting features from student responses using individual models, capturing both item-specific context and unique learned representations. The Gromov-Wasserstein distance then quantifies the similarity between these feature distributions, identifying the most compatible models for merging. Models exhibiting the smallest pairwise distances, typically in pairs or trios, are merged by combining only the shared layers preceding the classification head. This strategy results in a unified feature extractor while preserving separate classification heads for item-specific scoring. We validated our approach against human expert knowledge and a GPT-o1-based merging method. GW-SMM consistently outperformed both, achieving a higher micro F1 score, macro F1 score, exact match accuracy, and per-label accuracy. The improvements in micro F1 and per-label accuracy were statistically significant compared to GPT-o1-based merging (p=0.04, p=0.01). Additionally, GW-SMM reduced storage requirements by half without compromising much accuracy, demonstrating its computational efficiency alongside reliable scoring performance.

However, many cases do not interact with the healthcare system, posing significant challenges for traditional surveillance methods. The growth of publicly available online restaurant reviews and advancements in large language models (LLMs) present potential opportunities to extend disease surveillance by identifying public reports of GI illness. In this study, we introduce a novel annotation schema, developed with experts in GI illness, applied to the Yelp Open Dataset of reviews. Our annotations extend beyond binary disease detection, to include detailed extraction of information on symptoms and foods. We evaluate the performance of open-weight LLMs across these three tasks: GI illness detection, symptom extraction, and food extraction. We compare this performance to RoBERTa-based classification models fine-tuned specifically for these tasks. Our results show that using prompt-based approaches, LLMs achieve micro-F1 scores of over 90% for all three of our tasks. Using prompting alone, we achieve micro-F1 scores that exceed those of smaller fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate the robustness of LLMs in GI illness detection across three bias-focused experiments. Our results suggest that publicly available review text and LLMs offer substantial potential for public health surveillance of GI illness by enabling highly effective extraction of key information. While LLMs appear to exhibit minimal bias in processing, the inherent limitations of restaurant review data highlight the need for cautious interpretation of results.

Surveying the NLP Community	Julia Romberg, Christopher Schröder, Julius Gonsior, Katrin Tomanek, Fredrik Olsson	Supervised learning relies on annotated data, which is expensive to obtain. A longstanding strategy to reduce annotation costs is active learning, an iterative process, in which a human annotates only data instances deemed informative by a model. Large language models (LLMs) have pushed the effectiveness of active learning, but have also improved methods such as few- or zero-shot learning, and text synthesis - thereby introducing potential alternatives. This raises the question: has active learning become obsolete? To answer this fully, we must look beyond literature to practical experiences. We conduct an online survey in the NLP community to collect previously intangible insights on the perceived relevance of data annotation, particularly focusing on active learning, including best practices, obstacles and expected future developments. Our findings show that annotated data remains a key factor, and active learning continues to be relevant. While the majority of active learning users find it effective, a comparison with a community survey from over a decade ago reveals persistent challenges: setup complexity, estimation of cost reduction, and tooling.

In this paper, we introduce a novel numerical reasoning task under uncertainty, focusing on estimating the k-anonymity of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, which uses LLMs to factorize a joint probability distribution to estimate the k-value-the size of the population matching the given information-by modeling individual pieces of textual information as random variables. The probability of each factor occurring within a population is estimated using standalone LLMs or retrieval-augmented generation systems, and these probabilities are combined into a final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the correct k-value 67% of the time, an 11% increase compared to GPT-4o chain-of-thought reasoning. Additionally, we leverage LLM uncertainty to develop prediction intervals for k-anonymity, which include the correct value in nearly 92% of cases.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

Navigating so many models requires an atlas, but as most models are poorly documented charting such an atlas is challenging. To explore the hidden potential of model repositories, we chart a preliminary atlas representing the documented fraction of Hugging Face. It provides stunning visualizations of the model landscape and evolution. We demonstrate several applications of this atlas including predicting model attributes (e.g., accuracy), and analyzing trends in computer vision models. However, as the current atlas remains incomplete, we propose a method for charting undocumented regions. Specifically, we identify high-confidence structural priors based on dominant real-world model training practices. Leveraging these priors, our approach enables accurate mapping of previously undocumented areas of the atlas. We publicly release our datasets, code, and interactive atlas.

In this paper, we introduce SciVerse, a multi-modal scientific evaluation benchmark to thoroughly assess LMMs across 5,735 test instances in five distinct versions. We aim to investigate three key dimensions of LMMs: scientific knowledge comprehension, multi-modal content interpretation, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. To unveil whether LMMs possess sufficient scientific expertise, we first transform each problem into three versions containing different levels of knowledge required for solving, i.e., Knowledge-free, -lite, and -rich. Then, to explore how LMMs interpret multi-modal scientific content, we annotate another two versions, i.e., Vision-rich and -only, marking more question information from texts to diagrams. Comparing the results of different versions, SciVerse systematically examines the professional knowledge stock and visual perception skills of LMMs in scientific domains. In addition, to rigorously assess CoT reasoning, we propose a new scientific CoT evaluation strategy, conducting a step-wise assessment on knowledge and logical errors in model outputs. Our extensive evaluation of different LMMs on SciVerse reveals critical limitations in their scientific proficiency and provides new insights into future developments.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10622	Transformers without Normalization	Jiachen Zhu, Xinlei Chen, Kaiming He, Yann LeCun, Zhuang Liu	Normalization layers are ubiquitous in modern neural networks and have long been considered essential. This work demonstrates that Transformers without normalization can achieve the same or better performance using a remarkably simple technique. We introduce Dynamic Tanh (DyT), an element-wise operation $DyT($x$) = \tanh(\alpha $x$)$, as a drop-in replacement for normalization layers in Transformers. DyT is inspired by the observation that layer normalization in Transformers often produces tanh-like, $S$-shaped input-output mappings. By incorporating DyT, Transformers without normalization can match or exceed the performance of their normalized counterparts, mostly without hyperparameter tuning. We validate the effectiveness of Transformers with DyT across diverse settings, ranging from recognition to generation, supervised to self-supervised learning, and computer vision to language models. These findings challenge the conventional understanding that normalization layers are indispensable in modern neural networks, and offer new insights into their role in deep networks.

Unlike single-turn jailbreaks that rely on one meticulously engineered prompt, Siege expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion, branching out multiple adversarial prompts that exploit partial compliance from previous responses. By tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Siege reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs. Evaluations on the JailbreakBench dataset show that Siege achieves a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GPT-4 in a single multi-turn run, using fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOAT.

However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as ""per-token"" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist ""generic truthful directions"" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that TruthPrInt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be available at this https URL."	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]

In this work, we aim to address the scarcity issue of reasoning-focused multimodal datasets. We propose VisualWebInstruct - a novel approach that leverages search engine to create a diverse, and high-quality dataset spanning multiple disciplines like math, physics, finance, chemistry, etc. Starting with meticulously selected 30,000 seed images, we employ Google Image search to identify websites containing similar images. We collect and process the HTMLs from over 700K unique URL sources. Through a pipeline of content extraction, filtering and synthesis, we build a dataset of approximately 900K question-answer pairs, with 40% being visual QA pairs and the rest as text QA pairs. Models fine-tuned on VisualWebInstruct demonstrate significant performance gains: (1) training from Llava-OV-mid shows 10-20% absolute point gains across benchmarks, (2) training from MAmmoTH-VL shows 5% absoluate gain. Our best model MAmmoTH-VL2 shows state-of-the-art performance within the 10B parameter class on MMMU-Pro-std (40.7%), MathVerse (42.6%), and DynaMath (55.7%). These remarkable results highlight the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing VLMs' reasoning capabilities for complex multimodal tasks.	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10542	Language Models, Graph Searching, and Supervision Adulteration: When More Supervision is Less and How to Make More More	Arvid Frydenlund	"This work concerns the path-star task, a minimal example of searching over a graph. The graph, $G$, is star-shaped with $D$ arms radiating from a start node, $s$. A language model (LM) is given $G$, $s$, and a target node $t$, which ends one of the arms and is tasked with generating the arm containing $t$. The minimal nature of this task means only a single choice needs to be made: which of the $D$ arms contains $t$?
Decoder-only LMs fail to solve this elementary task above $1/D$ chance due to a learned shortcut that absorbs training supervision. We show how this pathology is caused by excess supervision and we present a series of solutions demonstrating that the task is solvable via decoder-only LMs. We find that the task's minimal nature causes its difficulty, as it prevents task decomposition. Our solutions provide insight into the pathology and its implications for LMs trained via next-token prediction."	Computation and Language	[ 13 Mar 2025]

Kang	In this paper, we propose BeamLLM, a vision-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) beam prediction framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to address the challenges of high training overhead and latency in mmWave communication systems. By combining computer vision (CV) with LLMs' cross-modal reasoning capabilities, the framework extracts user equipment (UE) positional features from RGB images and aligns visual-temporal features with LLMs' semantic space through reprogramming techniques. Evaluated on a realistic vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario, the proposed method achieves 61.01% top-1 accuracy and 97.39% top-3 accuracy in standard prediction tasks, significantly outperforming traditional deep learning models. In few-shot prediction scenarios, the performance degradation is limited to 12.56% (top-1) and 5.55% (top-3) from time sample 1 to 10, demonstrating superior prediction capability.

This work focuses on equality, inequality, and inclusion, along with the properties they satisfy, such as ir/reflexivity, a/symmetry, transitivity, and logical complexity (e.g., number of reasoning ``hops''). We propose an alternative to in-context learning that trains only the representations of newly introduced tokens, namely out-of-context representation learning. This method mitigates linguistic biases already present in a model and, differently from in-context learning, does not rely on external information or illustrations. We argue out-of-context representation learning as a better alternative to in-context learning and fine-tuning to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs on logic tasks that are the building blocks of more complex reasoning benchmarks.

This paper introduces a dynamically configurable and highly automated LLM/LVLM-powered pipeline for evaluating OSM solutions called OSMa-Bench (Open Semantic Mapping Benchmark). The study focuses on evaluating state-of-the-art semantic mapping algorithms under varying indoor lighting conditions, a critical challenge in indoor environments. We introduce a novel dataset with simulated RGB-D sequences and ground truth 3D reconstructions, facilitating the rigorous analysis of mapping performance across different lighting conditions. Through experiments on leading models such as ConceptGraphs, BBQ and OpenScene, we evaluate the semantic fidelity of object recognition and segmentation. Additionally, we introduce a Scene Graph evaluation method to analyze the ability of models to interpret semantic structure. The results provide insights into the robustness of these models, forming future research directions for developing resilient and adaptable robotic systems. Our code is available at this https URL.

Specifically, our model improves the reasoning performance of three types of MLLMs and four different model scales. Even when applied to the highly capable InternVL2.5-78B, it achieves a 5.9-point improvement across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that our model exhibits superior performance compared to Outcome Reward Models and Self-Consistency during BoN evaluation. To facilitate the training of multimodal PRMs, we construct a multimodal process supervision dataset VisualPRM400K using an automated data pipeline. For the evaluation of multimodal PRMs, we propose VisualProcessBench, a benchmark with human-annotated step-wise correctness labels, to measure the abilities of PRMs to detect erroneous steps in multimodal reasoning tasks. We hope that our work can inspire more future research and contribute to the development of MLLMs. Our model, data, and benchmark are released in this https URL.

Sánchez, Miriam Ugarte, Antonia Cazalilla, Vicente Cambrón, José A. Parejo, Aitor Arrieta, Sergio Segura	The battle for AI leadership is on, with OpenAI in the United States and DeepSeek in China as key contenders. In response to these global trends, the Spanish government has proposed ALIA, a public and transparent AI infrastructure incorporating small language models designed to support Spanish and co-official languages such as Basque.

The results, based on 670 conversations, revealed vulnerabilities in all the models under test, with biased or unsafe responses ranging from 29.5% in o3-mini to 50.6% in Salamandra. These findings underscore the persistent challenges in developing reliable and trustworthy AI systems, particularly those intended to support Spanish and Basque languages.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10094	Semantic Synergy: Unlocking Policy Insights and Learning Pathways Through Advanced Skill Mapping	Phoebe Koundouri, Conrad Landis, Georgios Feretzakis	This research introduces a comprehensive system based on state-of-the-art natural language processing, semantic embedding, and efficient search techniques for retrieving similarities and thus generating actionable insights from raw textual information. The system automatically extracts and aggregates normalized competencies from multiple documents (such as policy files and curricula vitae) and creates strong relationships between recognized competencies, occupation profiles, and related learning courses. To validate its performance, we conducted a multi-tier evaluation that included both explicit and implicit skill references in synthetic and real-world documents. The results showed near-human-level accuracy, with F1 scores exceeding 0.95 for explicit skill detection and above 0.93 for implicit mentions. The system thereby establishes a sound foundation for supporting in-depth collaboration across the AE4RIA network. The methodology involves a multi-stage pipeline based on extensive preprocessing and data cleaning, semantic embedding and segmentation via SentenceTransformer, and skill extraction using a FAISS-based search method. The extracted skills are associated with occupation frameworks (as formulated in the ESCO ontology) and with learning paths offered through the Sustainable Development Goals Academy. Moreover, interactive visualization software, implemented with Dash and Plotly, presents graphs and tables for real-time exploration and informed decision-making by those involved in policymaking, training and learning supply, career transitions, and recruitment. Overall, this system, backed by rigorous validation, offers promising prospects for improved policymaking, human resource development, and lifelong learning by providing structured and actionable insights from raw, complex textual information.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10061	Compute Optimal Scaling of Skills: Knowledge vs Reasoning	Nicholas Roberts, Niladri Chatterji, Sharan Narang, Mike Lewis, Dieuwke Hupkes	Scaling laws are a critical component of the LLM development pipeline, most famously as a way to forecast training decisions such as 'compute-optimally' trading-off parameter count and dataset size, alongside a more recent growing list of other crucial decisions. In this work, we ask whether compute-optimal scaling behaviour can be skill-dependent. In particular, we examine knowledge and reasoning-based skills such as knowledge-based QA and code generation, and we answer this question in the affirmative: $\textbf{scaling laws are skill-dependent}$. Next, to understand whether skill-dependent scaling is an artefact of the pretraining datamix, we conduct an extensive ablation of different datamixes and find that, also when correcting for datamix differences, $\textbf{knowledge and code exhibit fundamental differences in scaling behaviour}$. We conclude with an analysis of how our findings relate to standard compute-optimal scaling using a validation set, and find that $\textbf{a misspecified validation set can impact compute-optimal parameter count by nearly 50%,}$ depending on its skill composition.

However, existing datasets for evaluating LMM robustness offer limited exploration of extremist content, often lacking AI-generated images, diverse image generation models, and comprehensive coverage of historical events, which hinders a complete assessment of model vulnerabilities. To fill this gap, we introduce ExtremeAIGC, a benchmark dataset and evaluation framework designed to assess LMM vulnerabilities against such content. ExtremeAIGC simulates real-world events and malicious use cases by curating diverse text- and image-based examples crafted using state-of-the-art image generation techniques. Our study reveals alarming weaknesses in LMMs, demonstrating that even cutting-edge safety measures fail to prevent the generation of extremist material. We systematically quantify the success rates of various attack strategies, exposing critical gaps in current defenses and emphasizing the need for more robust mitigation strategies.

Existing methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), rely on centralized data collection, making them computationally expensive and privacy-invasive. We introduce PluralLLM a federated learning-based approach that enables multiple user groups to collaboratively train a transformer-based preference predictor without sharing sensitive data, which can also serve as a reward model for aligning LLMs. Our method leverages Federated Averaging (FedAvg) to aggregate preference updates efficiently, achieving 46% faster convergence, a 4% improvement in alignment scores, and nearly the same group fairness measure as in centralized training. Evaluated on a Q/A preference alignment task, PluralLLM demonstrates that federated preference learning offers a scalable and privacy-preserving alternative for aligning LLMs with diverse human values.

This paper studies Whisper and two model variants: one optimized for live speech streaming and another for offline transcription. Notably, these models have been found to generate hallucinated content, reducing transcription reliability. Furthermore, larger model variants exhibit increased latency and pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This study analyzes the similarities and differences between three Whisper models, qualitatively examining their distinct capabilities. Next, this study quantifies the impact of model quantization on latency and evaluates its viability for edge deployment. Using the open source LibriSpeech dataset, this paper evaluates the word error rate (WER) along with latency analysis of whispercpp using 3 quantization methods (INT4, INT5, INT8). Results show that quantization reduces latency by 19\% and model size by 45\%, while preserving transcription accuracy. These findings provide insights into the optimal use cases of different Whisper models and edge device deployment possibilities.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09837	On the Limitations of Vision-Language Models in Understanding Image Transforms	Ahmad Mustafa Anis, Hasnain Ali, Saquib Sarfraz	Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in various downstream tasks, including Image/Video Generation, Visual Question Answering, Multimodal Chatbots, and Video Understanding. However, these models often struggle with basic image transformations. This paper investigates the image-level understanding of VLMs, specifically CLIP by OpenAI and SigLIP by Google. Our findings reveal that these models lack comprehension of multiple image-level augmentations. To facilitate this study, we created an augmented version of the Flickr8k dataset, pairing each image with a detailed description of the applied transformation. We further explore how this deficiency impacts downstream tasks, particularly in image editing, and evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art Image2Image models on simple transformations.

Recent work develops an approach (DiLoCo) that relaxes synchronization demands without compromising model quality. However, these works do not carefully analyze how DiLoCo's behavior changes with model size. In this work, we study the scaling law behavior of DiLoCo when training LLMs under a fixed compute budget. We focus on how algorithmic factors, including number of model replicas, hyperparameters, and token budget affect training in ways that can be accurately predicted via scaling laws. We find that DiLoCo scales both predictably and robustly with model size. When well-tuned, DiLoCo scales better than data-parallel training with model size, and can outperform data-parallel training even at small model sizes. Our results showcase a more general set of benefits of DiLoCo than previously documented, including increased optimal batch sizes, improved downstream generalization with scale, and improved evaluation loss for a fixed token budget.

Balasubramanian, Leonid Sigal, Matthew A. Turk	The biases exhibited by Text-to-Image (TTI) models are often treated as if they are independent, but in reality, they may be deeply interrelated. Addressing bias along one dimension, such as ethnicity or age, can inadvertently influence another dimension, like gender, either mitigating or exacerbating existing disparities. Understanding these interdependencies is crucial for designing fairer generative models, yet measuring such effects quantitatively remains a challenge. In this paper, we aim to address these questions by introducing BiasConnect, a novel tool designed to analyze and quantify bias interactions in TTI models. Our approach leverages a counterfactual-based framework to generate pairwise causal graphs that reveals the underlying structure of bias interactions for the given text prompt. Additionally, our method provides empirical estimates that indicate how other bias dimensions shift toward or away from an ideal distribution when a given bias is modified. Our estimates have a strong correlation (+0.69) with the interdependency observations post bias mitigation. We demonstrate the utility of BiasConnect for selecting optimal bias mitigation axes, comparing different TTI models on the dependencies they learn, and understanding the amplification of intersectional societal biases in TTI models.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09730	Local Look-Ahead Guidance via Verifier-in-the-Loop for Automated Theorem Proving	Sara Rajaee, Kumar Pratik, Gabriele Cesa, Arash Behboodi	The most promising recent methods for AI reasoning require applying variants of reinforcement learning (RL) either on rolled out trajectories from the model, even for the step-wise rewards, or large quantities of human annotated trajectory data. The reliance on the rolled-out trajectory renders the compute cost and time prohibitively high. In particular, the correctness of a reasoning trajectory can typically only be judged at its completion, leading to sparse rewards in RL or requiring expensive synthetic data generation in expert iteration-like methods. In this work, we focus on the Automatic Theorem Proving (ATP) task and propose a novel verifier-in-the-loop design, which unlike existing approaches that leverage feedback on the entire reasoning trajectory, employs an automated verifier to give intermediate feedback at each step of the reasoning process. Using Lean as the verifier, we empirically show that the step-by-step local verification produces a global improvement in the model's reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09656	LLM-PS: Empowering Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Patterns and Semantics	Jialiang Tang, Shuo Chen, Chen Gong, Jing Zhang, Dacheng Tao	Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is critical in many real-world domains like financial planning and health monitoring. Recent studies have revealed that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful in-contextual modeling capabilities, hold significant potential for TSF. However, existing LLM-based methods usually perform suboptimally because they neglect the inherent characteristics of time series data. Unlike the textual data used in LLM pre-training, the time series data is semantically sparse and comprises distinctive temporal patterns. To address this problem, we propose LLM-PS to empower the LLM for TSF by learning the fundamental \textit{Patterns} and meaningful \textit{Semantics} from time series data. Our LLM-PS incorporates a new multi-scale convolutional neural network adept at capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends within the time series. Meanwhile, we introduce a time-to-text module for extracting valuable semantics across continuous time intervals rather than isolated time points. By integrating these patterns and semantics, LLM-PS effectively models temporal dependencies, enabling a deep comprehension of time series and delivering accurate forecasts. Intensive experimental results demonstrate that LLM-PS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-term forecasting tasks, as well as in few- and zero-shot settings.

Although some current works have achieved satisfactory results in the task of single-person dance generation, the field of multi-person dance generation remains relatively novel. In this work, we present a group choreography framework that leverages recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLM) by modeling the group dance generation problem as a sequence-to-sequence translation task. Our framework consists of a tokenizer that transforms continuous features into discrete tokens, and an LLM that is fine-tuned to predict motion tokens given the audio tokens. We show that by proper tokenization of input modalities and careful design of the LLM training strategies, our framework can generate realistic and diverse group dances while maintaining strong music correlation and dancer-wise consistency. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

A Case Study on Vaccine Hesitancy	Abe Bohan Hou, Hongru Du, Yichen Wang, Jingyu Zhang, Zixiao Wang, Paul Pu Liang, Daniel Khashabi, Lauren Gardner, Tianxing He	Can we simulate a sandbox society with generative agents to model human behavior, thereby reducing the over-reliance on real human trials for assessing public policies? In this work, we investigate the feasibility of simulating health-related decision-making, using vaccine hesitancy, defined as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services (MacDonald, 2015), as a case study. To this end, we introduce the VacSim framework with 100 generative agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). VacSim simulates vaccine policy outcomes with the following steps: 1) instantiate a population of agents with demographics based on census data; 2) connect the agents via a social network and model vaccine attitudes as a function of social dynamics and disease-related information; 3) design and evaluate various public health interventions aimed at mitigating vaccine hesitancy. To align with real-world results, we also introduce simulation warmup and attitude modulation to adjust agents' attitudes. We propose a series of evaluations to assess the reliability of various LLM simulations. Experiments indicate that models like Llama and Qwen can simulate aspects of human behavior but also highlight real-world alignment challenges, such as inconsistent responses with demographic profiles. This early exploration of LLM-driven simulations is not meant to serve as definitive policy guidance; instead, it serves as a call for action to examine social simulation for policy development.

We introduce the Factorio Learning Environment (FLE), based on the game of Factorio, that tests agents in long-term planning, program synthesis, and resource optimization. FLE provides exponentially scaling challenges -- from basic automation to complex factories processing millions of resource units per second. We provide two settings: (1) lab-play consisting of eight structured tasks with fixed resources, and (2) open-play with the unbounded task of building the largest factory on an procedurally generated map. We demonstrate across both settings that models still lack strong spatial reasoning. In lab-play, we find that LLMs exhibit promising short-horizon skills, yet are unable to operate effectively in constrained environments, reflecting limitations in error analysis. In open-play, while LLMs discover automation strategies that improve growth (e.g electric-powered drilling), they fail to achieve complex automation (e.g electronic-circuit manufacturing).

This paper initially introduces a dual-metric evaluation method, comprising Boundary Clarity and Chunk Stickiness, to enable the direct quantification of chunking quality. Leveraging this assessment method, we highlight the inherent limitations of traditional and semantic chunking in handling complex contextual nuances, thereby substantiating the necessity of integrating LLMs into chunking process. To address the inherent trade-off between computational efficiency and chunking precision in LLM-based approaches, we devise the granularity-aware Mixture-of-Chunkers (MoC) framework, which consists of a three-stage processing mechanism. Notably, our objective is to guide the chunker towards generating a structured list of chunking regular expressions, which are subsequently employed to extract chunks from the original text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both our proposed metrics and the MoC framework effectively settle challenges of the chunking task, revealing the chunking kernel while enhancing the performance of the RAG system.

Investigating LLM Responses to Implicit Misinformation	Ruohao Guo, Wei Xu, Alan Ritter	As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in diverse scenarios, the extent to which they could tacitly spread misinformation emerges as a critical safety concern. Current research primarily evaluates LLMs on explicit false statements, overlooking how misinformation often manifests subtly as unchallenged premises in real-world user interactions. We curated ECHOMIST, the first comprehensive benchmark for implicit misinformation, where the misinformed assumptions are embedded in a user query to LLMs. ECHOMIST is based on rigorous selection criteria and carefully curated data from diverse sources, including real-world human-AI conversations and social media interactions. We also introduce a new evaluation metric to measure whether LLMs can recognize and counter false information rather than amplify users' misconceptions. Through an extensive empirical study on a wide range of LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude, and Llama, we find that current models perform alarmingly poorly on this task, often failing to detect false premises and generating misleading explanations. Our findings underscore the critical need for an increased focus on implicit misinformation in LLM safety research.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

Existing efforts have primarily described complex relationships among model performance, parameter size, and data size, as well as searched for the optimal compute allocation to train LLMs. However, they overlook the impacts of context length and attention head configuration (the number of query and key-value heads in grouped-query attention) on training and inference. In this paper, we systematically compare models with different parameter sizes, context lengths, and attention head configurations in terms of model performance, computational cost, and memory cost. Then, we extend the existing scaling methods, which are based solely on parameter size and training compute, to guide the construction of cost-optimal LLMs during both training and inference. Our quantitative scaling studies show that, when processing sufficiently long sequences, a larger model with fewer attention heads can achieve a lower loss while incurring lower computational and memory costs. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing practical LLMs, especially in long-context processing scenarios. We will publicly release our code and data.

However, applying them for complex, multi-step, long-horizon tasks remains a challenge. Recent work have found success by separating high-level planning from low-level execution, which enables the model to effectively balance high-level planning objectives and low-level execution details. However, generating accurate plans remains difficult since LLMs are not inherently trained for this task. To address this, we propose Plan-and-Act, a novel framework that incorporates explicit planning into LLM-based agents and introduces a scalable method to enhance plan generation through a novel synthetic data generation method. Plan-and-Act consists of a Planner model which generates structured, high-level plans to achieve user goals, and an Executor model that translates these plans into environment-specific actions. To train the Planner effectively, we introduce a synthetic data generation method that annotates ground-truth trajectories with feasible plans, augmented with diverse and extensive examples to enhance generalization. We evaluate Plan-and-Act using web navigation as a representative long-horizon planning environment, demonstrating a state-of the-art 54% success rate on the WebArena-Lite benchmark.

Prior work shows that the training process can yield significantly different results in response to slight variations in initial conditions, e.g., the random seed. Crucially, the research community still lacks sufficient resources and tools to systematically investigate pre-training stability, particularly for decoder-only language models. We introduce the PolyPythias, a set of 45 new training runs for the Pythia model suite: 9 new seeds across 5 model sizes, from 14M to 410M parameters, resulting in about 7k new checkpoints that we release. Using these new 45 training runs, in addition to the 5 already available, we study the effects of different initial conditions determined by the seed -- i.e., parameters' initialisation and data order -- on (i) downstream performance, (ii) learned linguistic representations, and (iii) emergence of training phases. In addition to common scaling behaviours, our analyses generally reveal highly consistent training dynamics across both model sizes and initial conditions. Further, the new seeds for each model allow us to identify outlier training runs and delineate their characteristics. Our findings show the potential of using these methods to predict training stability.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

Retrieval augmentation and tool-use training approaches where a search engine is treated as a tool lack complex multi-turn retrieval flexibility or require large-scale supervised data. Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities during inference to use search engines is not optimal, since the LLM does not learn how to optimally interact with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of the DeepSeek-R1 model where the LLM learns -- solely through reinforcement learning (RL) -- to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM rollouts with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 26% (Qwen2.5-7B), 21% (Qwen2.5-3B), and 10% (LLaMA3.2-3B) over SOTA baselines. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

With a focus on fast, real-time performance, TRACE tracks the speech, actions, gestures, and visual attention of participants, uses these multimodal inputs to determine the set of task-relevant propositions that have been raised as the dialogue progresses, and tracks the group's epistemic position and beliefs toward them as the task unfolds. Amid increased interest in AI systems that can mediate collaborations, TRACE represents an important step forward for agents that can engage with multiparty, multimodal discourse.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09481	BAMBI: Developing Baby Language Models for Italian	Alice Suozzi, Luca Capone, Gianluca E. Lebani, Alessandro Lenci	This paper presents BAMBI (BAby language Models Boostrapped for Italian), a series of Baby Language Models (BabyLMs) trained on data that mimic the linguistic input received by a five-year-old Italian-speaking child. The BAMBI models are tested using a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate language models, which takes into account the amount of training input the models received. The BAMBI models are compared against a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal language model (VLM) to study the contribution of extralinguistic information for language acquisition. The results of our evaluation align with the existing literature on English language models, confirming that while reduced training data support the development of relatively robust syntactic competence, they are insufficient for fostering semantic understanding. However, the gap between the training resources (data and computation) of the BAMBI models and the LLMs is not fully reflected in their performance: despite LLMs' massive training, their performance is not much better than that of BAMBI models. This suggests that strategies beyond scaling training resources, such as data curation, inclusion of multimodal input, and other training strategies such as curriculum learning, could play a crucial role in shaping model performance.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09454	Explicit Learning and the LLM in Machine Translation	Malik Marmonier, Rachel Bawden, Benoît Sagot	This study explores the capacity of large language models (LLMs) for explicit learning, a process involving the assimilation of metalinguistic explanations to carry out language tasks. Using constructed languages generated by cryptographic means as controlled test environments, we designed experiments to assess an LLM's ability to explicitly learn and apply grammar rules. Our results demonstrate that while LLMs possess a measurable capacity for explicit learning, this ability diminishes as the complexity of the linguistic phenomena at hand increases. Supervised fine-tuning on chains of thought significantly enhances LLM performance but struggles to generalize to typologically novel or more complex linguistic features. These findings point to the need for more diverse training sets and alternative fine-tuning strategies to further improve explicit learning by LLMs.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.09443	Florenz: Scaling Laws for Systematic Generalization in Vision-Language Models	Julian Spravil, Sebastian Houben, Sven Behnke	Cross-lingual transfer enables vision-language models (VLMs) to perform vision tasks in various languages with training data only in one language. Current approaches rely on large pre-trained multilingual language models. However, they face the curse of multilinguality, sacrificing downstream task performance for multilingual capabilities, struggling with lexical ambiguities, and falling behind recent advances. In this work, we study the scaling laws of systematic generalization with monolingual VLMs for multilingual tasks, focusing on the impact of model size and seen training samples. We propose Florenz, a monolingual encoder-decoder VLM with 0.4B to 11.2B parameters combining the pre-trained VLM Florence-2 and the large language model Gemma-2. Florenz is trained with varying compute budgets on a synthetic dataset that features intentionally incomplete language coverage for image captioning, thus, testing generalization from the fully covered translation task. We show that not only does indirectly learning unseen task-language pairs adhere to a scaling law, but also that with our data generation pipeline and the proposed Florenz model family, image captioning abilities can emerge in a specific language even when only data for the translation task is available. Fine-tuning on a mix of downstream datasets yields competitive performance and demonstrates promising scaling trends in multimodal machine translation (Multi30K, CoMMuTE), lexical disambiguation (CoMMuTE), and image captioning (Multi30K, XM3600, COCO Karpathy).

To combat the prohibitive costs of creating manual gold annotated data, this paper explores two methods to automatically create datasets with coreferential annotations; direct conversion from existing datasets, and parsing using multilingual models capable of handling new and unseen languages. The paper details the current progress on those two fronts, as well as the challenges the efforts currently face, and our approach to overcoming these challenges.

These methods have found success in the field, but their effectiveness has not been demonstrated outside of high-resource languages. In this work, we discuss our experiences in post-training an LLM for instruction-following for English and Finnish. We use a multilingual LLM to translate instruction and preference datasets from English to Finnish. We perform instruction tuning and preference optimization in English and Finnish and evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of the model in both languages. Our results show that with a few hundred Finnish instruction samples we can obtain competitive performance in Finnish instruction-following. We also found that although preference optimization in English offers some cross-lingual benefits, we obtain our best results by using preference data from both languages.

The lack of unified standards, including format, terminology, and style, is a great challenge in clinical fundus diagnostic reports, which increases the difficulty for large language models (LLMs) to understand the data. To address this, we construct a bilingual standard terminology, containing fundus clinical terms and commonly used descriptions in clinical diagnosis. Then, we establish two models, RetSTA-7B-Zero and RetSTA-7B. RetSTA-7B-Zero, fine-tuned on an augmented dataset simulating clinical scenarios, demonstrates powerful standardization behaviors. However, it encounters a challenge of limitation to cover a wider range of diseases. To further enhance standardization performance, we build RetSTA-7B, which integrates a substantial amount of standardized data generated by RetSTA-7B-Zero along with corresponding English data, covering diverse complex clinical scenarios and achieving report-level standardization for the first time. Experimental results demonstrate that RetSTA-7B outperforms other compared LLMs in bilingual standardization task, which validates its superior performance and generalizability.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09348	MOAT: Evaluating LMMs for Capability Integration and Instruction Grounding	Zhoutong Ye, Mingze Sun, Huan-ang Gao, Chun Yu, Yuanchun Shi	Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential as generalists in vision-language (VL) tasks. However, there remains a significant gap between state-of-the-art LMMs and human performance when it comes to complex tasks that require a combination of fundamental VL capabilities, as well as tasks involving the grounding of complex instructions. To thoroughly investigate the human-LMM gap and its underlying causes, we propose MOAT, a diverse benchmark with complex real-world VL tasks that are challenging for LMMs. Specifically, the tasks in MOAT require LMMs to engage in generalist problem solving by integrating fundamental VL capabilities such as reading text, counting, understanding spatial relations, grounding textual and visual instructions, etc. All these abilities fit into a taxonomy proposed by us that contains 10 fundamental VL capabilities, enabling MOAT to provide a fine-grained view of LMMs' strengths and weaknesses. Besides, MOAT is the first benchmark to explicitly evaluate LMMs' ability to ground complex text and visual instructions, which is essential to many real-world applications. We evaluate over 20 proprietary and open source LMMs, as well as humans, on MOAT, and found that humans achieved 82.7% accuracy while the best performing LMM (OpenAI o1) achieved only 38.8%. To guide future model development, we analyze common trends in our results and discuss the underlying causes of observed performance gaps between LMMs and humans, focusing on which VL capability forms the bottleneck in complex tasks, whether test time scaling improves performance on MOAT, and how tiling harms LMMs' capability to count.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09347	Safer or Luckier? LLMs as Safety Evaluators Are Not Robust to Artifacts	Hongyu Chen, Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant	Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as automated evaluators to assess the safety of generated content, yet their reliability in this role remains uncertain. This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge models across critical safety domains, examining three key aspects: self-consistency in repeated judging tasks, alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts such as apologetic or verbose phrasing. Our findings reveal that biases in LLM judges can significantly distort the final verdict on which content source is safer, undermining the validity of comparative evaluations. Notably, apologetic language artifacts alone can skew evaluator preferences by up to 98\%. Contrary to expectations, larger models do not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models sometimes show higher resistance to specific artifacts. To mitigate LLM evaluator robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions from multiple models. Although this approach both improves robustness and enhances alignment to human judgements, artifact sensitivity persists even with the best jury configurations. These results highlight the urgent need for diversified, artifact-resistant methodologies to ensure reliable safety assessments.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

This study explores the impact of model architecture on harmful language detection by evaluating a curated database of technical terms, each paired with specific use cases. We tested a range of encoder, decoder, and encoder-decoder language models, including BERT-base-uncased, RoBERTa large-mnli, Gemini Flash 1.5 and 2.0, GPT-4, Claude AI Sonnet 3.5, T5-large, and BART-large-mnli. Each model was presented with a standardized prompt to identify harmful and non-inclusive language across 64 terms. Results reveal that decoder models, particularly Gemini Flash 2.0 and Claude AI, excel in nuanced contextual analysis, while encoder models like BERT exhibit strong pattern recognition but struggle with classification certainty. We discuss the implications of these findings for improving automated detection tools and highlight model-specific strengths and limitations in fostering inclusive communication in technical domains.

This includes DP text privatization, where potentially sensitive input texts are transformed under DP to achieve privatized output texts that ideally mask sensitive information $\textit{and}$ maintain original semantics. Despite continued work to address the open challenges in DP text privatization, there remains a scarcity of work addressing user perceptions of this technology, a crucial aspect which serves as the final barrier to practical adoption. In this work, we conduct a survey study with 721 laypersons around the globe, investigating how the factors of $\textit{scenario}$, $\textit{data sensitivity}$, $\textit{mechanism type}$, and $\textit{reason for data collection}$ impact user preferences for text privatization. We learn that while all these factors play a role in influencing privacy decisions, users are highly sensitive to the utility and coherence of the private output texts. Our findings highlight the socio-technical factors that must be considered in the study of DP NLP, opening the door to further user-based investigations going forward.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09326	A Survey on Enhancing Causal Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models	Xin Li, Zhuo Cai, Shoujin Wang, Kun Yu, Fang Chen	Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in language tasks and beyond. However, due to their limited inherent causal reasoning ability, LLMs still face challenges in handling tasks that require robust causal reasoning ability, such as health-care and economic analysis. As a result, a growing body of research has focused on enhancing the causal reasoning ability of LLMs. Despite the booming research, there lacks a survey to well review the challenges, progress and future directions in this area. To bridge this significant gap, we systematically review literature on how to strengthen LLMs' causal reasoning ability in this paper. We start from the introduction of background and motivations of this topic, followed by the summarisation of key challenges in this area. Thereafter, we propose a novel taxonomy to systematically categorise existing methods, together with detailed comparisons within and between classes of methods. Furthermore, we summarise existing benchmarks and evaluation metrics for assessing LLMs' causal reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions for this emerging field, offering insights and inspiration to researchers and practitioners in the area.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

With the recent advances in language modeling thanks to the introduction of Large Language Models, the possibility of extracting embeddings from these large and extensively trained models has been explored. However, current studies focus on textual embeddings in English, which is also the main language on which these models have been trained. Furthermore, there are very few models that consider multimodal and multilingual input. In light of this, we propose an adaptation methodology for Large Vision-Language Models trained on English language data to improve their performance in extracting multilingual and multimodal embeddings. Finally, we design and introduce a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of multilingual and multimodal embedding models.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

AI-Generated Product Review Detection in Dravidian Languages	Somsubhra De, Advait Vats	The rise of Generative AI has led to a surge in AI-generated reviews, often posing a serious threat to the credibility of online platforms. Reviews serve as the primary source of information about products and services. Authentic reviews play a vital role in consumer decision-making. The presence of fabricated content misleads consumers, undermines trust and facilitates potential fraud in digital marketplaces. This study focuses on detecting AI-generated product reviews in Tamil and Malayalam, two low-resource languages where research in this domain is relatively under-explored. We worked on a range of approaches - from traditional machine learning methods to advanced transformer-based models such as Indic-BERT, IndicSBERT, MuRIL, XLM-RoBERTa and MalayalamBERT. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging the state-of-the-art transformers in accurately identifying AI-generated content, demonstrating the potential in enhancing the detection of fake reviews in low-resource language settings.

We propose a Diverse Length-aware Maximal Marginal Relevance (DL-MMR) algorithm to better control summary lengths. This algorithm combines the query relevance with diverse target lengths in retrieval-augmented summarization. Unlike previous methods that necessitate exhaustive exemplar exemplar relevance comparisons using MMR, DL-MMR considers the exemplar target length as well and avoids comparing exemplars to each other, thereby reducing computational cost and conserving memory during the construction of an exemplar pool. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of DL-MMR, which considers length diversity, compared to the original MMR algorithm. DL-MMR additionally showed the effectiveness in memory saving of 781,513 times and computational cost reduction of 500,092 times, while maintaining the same level of informativeness.

Chao	"Investigating bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for developing trustworthy AI. While prompt-based through prompt engineering is common, its effectiveness relies on the assumption that models inherently understand biases. Our study systematically analyzed this assumption using the BBQ and StereoSet benchmarks on both open-source models as well as commercial GPT model. Experimental results indicate that prompt-based is often superficial; for instance, the Llama2-7B-Chat model misclassified over 90% of unbiased content as biased, despite achieving high accuracy in identifying bias issues on the BBQ dataset. Additionally, specific evaluation and question settings in bias benchmarks often lead LLMs to choose ""evasive answers"", disregarding the core of the question and the relevance of the response to the context. Moreover, the apparent success of previous methods may stem from flawed evaluation metrics. Our research highlights a potential ""false prosperity"" in prompt-base efforts and emphasizes the need to rethink bias metrics to ensure truly trustworthy AI."

Pan	Recent advancements of in-context learning (ICL) show language models can significantly improve their performance when demonstrations are provided. However, little attention has been paid to model calibration and prediction confidence of ICL in cross-lingual scenarios. To bridge this gap, we conduct a thorough analysis of ICL for cross-lingual sentiment classification. Our findings suggest that ICL performs poorly in cross-lingual scenarios, exhibiting low accuracy and presenting high calibration errors. In response, we propose a novel approach, N2C2, which employs a -nearest neighbors augmented classifier for prediction confidence calibration. N2C2 narrows the prediction gap by leveraging a datastore of cached few-shot instances. Specifically, N2C2 integrates the predictions from the datastore and incorporates confidence-aware distribution, semantically consistent retrieval representation, and adaptive neighbor combination modules to effectively utilize the limited number of supporting instances. Evaluation on two multilingual sentiment classification datasets demonstrates that N2C2 outperforms traditional ICL. It surpasses fine tuning, prompt tuning and recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and calibration errors.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.09202	Token Weighting for Long-Range Language Modeling	Falko Helm, Nico Daheim, Iryna Gurevych	Many applications of large language models (LLMs) require long-context understanding, but models continue to struggle with such tasks. We hypothesize that conventional next-token prediction training could contribute to this, because each token is assigned equal weight. Yet, intuitively, the amount of context needed to predict the next token accurately varies greatly across different data. To reflect this, we propose various novel token-weighting schemes that assign different weights to each training token in the loss, thereby generalizing existing works. For this, we categorize token-weighting methods using a two-step framework which compares the confidences of a long-context and short-context model to score tokens. We evaluate all methods on multiple long-context understanding tasks and show that non-uniform loss weights are helpful to improve the long-context abilities of LLMs. Different short-context models can be used effectively for token scoring, including models that are much smaller than the long-context model that is trained. All in all, this work contributes to a better understanding of the trade-offs long-context language modeling faces and provides guidelines for model steering via loss-weighting based on empirical evidence. The code can be found on Github.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

LLM-based Negative Reasoning for Fake News Detection	Chaowei Zhang, Zongling Feng, Zewei Zhang, Jipeng Qiang, Guandong Xu, Yun Li	The questionable responses caused by knowledge hallucination may lead to LLMs' unstable ability in decision-making. However, it has never been investigated whether the LLMs' hallucination is possibly usable to generate negative reasoning for facilitating the detection of fake news. This study proposes a novel supervised self-reinforced reasoning rectification approach - SR$^3$ that yields both common reasonable reasoning and wrong understandings (negative reasoning) for news via LLMs reflection for semantic consistency learning. Upon that, we construct a negative reasoning-based news learning model called - \emph{NRFE}, which leverages positive or negative news-reasoning pairs for learning the semantic consistency between them. To avoid the impact of label-implicated reasoning, we deploy a student model - \emph{NRFE-D} that only takes news content as input to inspect the performance of our method by distilling the knowledge from \emph{NRFE}. The experimental results verified on three popular fake news datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with three kinds of baselines including prompting on LLMs, fine-tuning on pre-trained SLMs, and other representative fake news detection methods.

However, they also present challenges, particularly in generating vaccine-related misinformation, which poses risks to public health. Despite research on human-authored misinformation, a notable gap remains in understanding how LLMs contribute to vaccine misinformation and how best to detect it. Existing benchmarks often overlook vaccine-specific misinformation and the diverse roles of misinformation spreaders. This paper introduces VaxGuard, a novel dataset designed to address these challenges. VaxGuard includes vaccine-related misinformation generated by multiple LLMs and provides a comprehensive framework for detecting misinformation across various roles. Our findings show that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o consistently outperform other LLMs in detecting misinformation, especially when dealing with subtle or emotionally charged narratives. On the other hand, PHI3 and Mistral show lower performance, struggling with precision and recall in fear-driven contexts. Additionally, detection performance tends to decline as input text length increases, indicating the need for improved methods to handle larger content. These results highlight the importance of role-specific detection strategies and suggest that VaxGuard can serve as a key resource for improving the detection of LLM-generated vaccine misinformation.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09094	Domain Adaptation for Japanese Sentence Embeddings with Contrastive Learning based on Synthetic Sentence Generation	Zihao Chen, Hisashi Handa, Miho Ohsaki, Kimiaki Shirahama	Several backbone models pre-trained on general domain datasets can encode a sentence into a widely useful embedding. Such sentence embeddings can be further enhanced by domain adaptation that adapts a backbone model to a specific domain. However, domain adaptation for low-resource languages like Japanese is often difficult due to the scarcity of large-scale labeled datasets. To overcome this, this paper introduces SDJC (Self-supervised Domain adaptation for Japanese sentence embeddings with Contrastive learning) that utilizes a data generator to generate sentences, which have the same syntactic structure to a sentence in an unlabeled specific domain corpus but convey different semantic meanings. Generated sentences are then used to boost contrastive learning that adapts a backbone model to accurately discriminate sentences in the specific domain. In addition, the components of SDJC like a backbone model and a method to adapt it need to be carefully selected, but no benchmark dataset is available for Japanese. Thus, a comprehensive Japanese STS (Semantic Textual Similarity) benchmark dataset is constructed by combining datasets machine-translated from English with existing datasets. The experimental results validates the effectiveness of SDJC on two domain-specific downstream tasks as well as the usefulness of the constructed dataset. Datasets, codes and backbone models adapted by SDJC are available on our github repository this https URL.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

Therefore, this work proposes a difficulty-aware self-training (DAST) framework that focuses on improving both the quantity and quality of self-generated responses on challenging queries during self-training. DAST is specified in three components: 1) sampling-based difficulty level estimation, 2) difficulty-aware data augmentation, and 3) the self-training algorithm using SFT and DPO respectively. Experiments on mathematical tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of DAST, highlighting the critical role of difficulty-aware strategies in advancing LLM self-training.

Limits to RLHF Based Alignment	Logan Barnhart, Reza Akbarian Bafghi, Stephen Becker, Maziar Raissi	Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the effectiveness of RLHF in addressing underlying biases remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between RLHF and both covert and overt biases in LLMs, particularly focusing on biases against African Americans. We applied various RLHF techniques (DPO, ORPO, and RLOO) to Llama 3 8B and evaluated the covert and overt biases of the resulting models using matched-guise probing and explicit bias testing. We performed additional tests with DPO on different base models and datasets; among several implications, we found that SFT before RLHF calcifies model biases. Additionally, we extend the tools for measuring biases to multi-modal models. Through our experiments we collect evidence that indicates that current alignment techniques are inadequate for nebulous tasks such as mitigating covert biases, highlighting the need for capable datasets, data curating techniques, or alignment tools.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.08963	Gradient-guided Attention Map Editing: Towards Efficient Contextual Hallucination Mitigation	Yu Wang, Jiaxin Zhang, Xiang Gao, Wendi Cui, Peng Li, Kamalika Das	"In tasks like summarization and open-book question answering (QA), Large Language Models (LLMs) often encounter ""contextual hallucination"", where they produce irrelevant or incorrect responses despite having access to accurate source information. This typically occurs because these models tend to prioritize self-generated content over the input context, causing them to disregard pertinent details. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method called ""Guided Attention Map Editing"" (GAME), which dynamically adjusts attention maps to improve contextual relevance. During inference, GAME employs a trained classifier to identify attention maps prone to inducing hallucinations and executes targeted interventions. These interventions, guided by gradient-informed ""edit directions'', strategically redistribute attention weights across various heads to effectively reduce hallucination. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging summarization and open-book QA tasks show that GAME consistently reduces hallucinations across a variety of open-source models. Specifically, GAME reduces hallucinations by 10% in the XSum summarization task while achieving a 7X speed-up in computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art baselines."

Current safety alignment methods, such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based approaches, can exhibit vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and often result in shallow safety alignment, primarily focusing on preventing harmful content in the initial tokens of the generated output. While methods like resetting can help recover from unsafe generations by discarding previous tokens and restarting the generation process, they are not well-suited for addressing nuanced safety violations like toxicity that may arise within otherwise benign and lengthy generations. In this paper, we propose a novel backtracking method designed to address these limitations. Our method allows the model to revert to a safer generation state, not necessarily at the beginning, when safety violations occur during generation. This approach enables targeted correction of problematic segments without discarding the entire generated text, thereby preserving efficiency. We demonstrate that our method dramatically reduces toxicity appearing through the generation process with minimal impact to efficiency.	Computation and Language	[ 11 Mar 2025]

Toward these goals for Language Model (LM) evaluations, we formulate the problem of generating a weakness profile, a set of weaknesses expressed in natural language, given an LM's performance on every individual instance in a benchmark. We introduce a suite of quantitative assessments to compare different weakness profiling methods. We also propose a weakness profiling method EvalTree. It constructs a capability tree where each node represents a capability described in natural language and is linked to a subset of benchmark instances that specifically evaluate this capability; it then extracts nodes where the LM performs poorly to generate a weakness profile. On the MATH and WildChat benchmarks, we show that EvalTree outperforms baseline weakness profiling methods by identifying weaknesses more precisely and comprehensively. Weakness profiling further enables weakness-guided data collection, and training data collection guided by EvalTree-identified weaknesses improves LM performance more than other data collection strategies. We also show how EvalTree exposes flaws in Chatbot Arena's human-voter-based evaluation practice. To facilitate future work, we release our code and an interface that allows practitioners to interactively explore the capability trees built by EvalTree.	Computation and Language	[ 11 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.08890	PlainQAFact: Automatic Factuality Evaluation Metric for Biomedical Plain Language Summaries Generation	Zhiwen You, Yue Guo	Hallucinated outputs from language models pose risks in the medical domain, especially for lay audiences making health-related decisions. Existing factuality evaluation methods, such as entailment- and question-answering-based (QA), struggle with plain language summary (PLS) generation due to elaborative explanation phenomenon, which introduces external content (e.g., definitions, background, examples) absent from the source document to enhance comprehension. To address this, we introduce PlainQAFact, a framework trained on a fine-grained, human-annotated dataset PlainFact, to evaluate the factuality of both source-simplified and elaboratively explained sentences. PlainQAFact first classifies factuality type and then assesses factuality using a retrieval-augmented QA-based scoring method. Our approach is lightweight and computationally efficient. Empirical results show that existing factuality metrics fail to effectively evaluate factuality in PLS, especially for elaborative explanations, whereas PlainQAFact achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further analyze its effectiveness across external knowledge sources, answer extraction strategies, overlap measures, and document granularity levels, refining its overall factuality assessment.

However, the growing key-value (KV) cache and the high computational complexity of attention create significant bottlenecks in memory usage and latency. In this paper, we find that attention in diverse long-context tasks exhibits sparsity, and LLMs implicitly ""know"" which tokens can be dropped or evicted at the head level after the pre-filling stage. Based on this insight, we propose Self-Attention Guided Eviction~(SAGE-KV), a simple and effective KV eviction cache method for long-context inference. After prefilling, our method performs a one-time top-k selection at both the token and head levels to compress the KV cache, enabling efficient inference with the reduced cache. Evaluations on LongBench and three long-context LLMs (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct-128k, Llama3-8B-Prolong-512k-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-128k) show that SAGE-KV maintains accuracy comparable to full attention while significantly improving efficiency. Specifically, SAGE-KV achieves 4x higher memory efficiency with improved accuracy over the static KV cache selection method StreamLLM, and 2x higher memory efficiency with better accuracy than the dynamic KV cache selection method Quest."

Conventional DST methods struggle with open-domain dialogues and noisy inputs. Motivated by the generative capabilities of LLMs, our Natural Language DST (NL-DST) framework trains an LLM to directly synthesize human-readable state descriptions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on MultiWOZ 2.1 and Taskmaster-1 datasets that NL-DST significantly outperforms rule-based and discriminative BERT-based DST baselines, as well as generative slot-filling GPT-2 DST models, in both Joint Goal Accuracy and Slot Accuracy. Ablation studies and human evaluations further validate the effectiveness of natural language state generation, highlighting its robustness to noise and enhanced interpretability. Our findings suggest that NL-DST offers a more flexible, accurate, and human-understandable approach to dialogue state tracking, paving the way for more robust and adaptable task-oriented dialogue systems.

Traditional approaches often fall short in capturing these complexities, particularly when relying on manually annotated dialogue relations. This paper introduces Speaker-Attentive LLM (SA-LLM), a novel generative model that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and a speaker-aware contrastive learning strategy to address these challenges. SA-LLM incorporates a speaker-attributed input encoding and a contrastive learning objective to implicitly learn contextual coherence and speaker roles without explicit relation annotations. Extensive experiments on the Ubuntu IRC and Movie Dialogues datasets demonstrate that SA-LLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in automatic and human evaluations, achieving superior performance in fluency, coherence, informativeness, and response diversity. Ablation studies and detailed error analyses further validate the effectiveness of the proposed speaker-attentive training approach, highlighting its robustness across different speaker roles and context lengths. The results underscore the potential of SA-LLM as a powerful and annotation-free solution for high-quality multi-party dialogue generation.	Computation and Language	[ 11 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.08838	evoBPE: Evolutionary Protein Sequence Tokenization	Burak Suyunu, Özdeniz Dolu, Arzucan Özgür	Recent advancements in computational biology have drawn compelling parallels between protein sequences and linguistic structures, highlighting the need for sophisticated tokenization methods that capture the intricate evolutionary dynamics of protein sequences. Current subword tokenization techniques, primarily developed for natural language processing, often fail to represent protein sequences' complex structural and functional properties adequately. This study introduces evoBPE, a novel tokenization approach that integrates evolutionary mutation patterns into sequence segmentation, addressing critical limitations in existing methods. By leveraging established substitution matrices, evoBPE transcends traditional frequency-based tokenization strategies. The method generates candidate token pairs through biologically informed mutations, evaluating them based on pairwise alignment scores and frequency thresholds. Extensive experiments on human protein sequences show that evoBPE performs better across multiple dimensions. Domain conservation analysis reveals that evoBPE consistently outperforms standard Byte-Pair Encoding, particularly as vocabulary size increases. Furthermore, embedding similarity analysis using ESM-2 suggests that mutation-based token replacements preserve biological sequence properties more effectively than arbitrary substitutions. The research contributes to protein sequence representation by introducing a mutation-aware tokenization method that better captures evolutionary nuances. By bridging computational linguistics and molecular biology, evoBPE opens new possibilities for machine learning applications in protein function prediction, structural modeling, and evolutionary analysis.

However, evidence suggests that these explanations can misrepresent the models' true reasoning processes. One effective way to identify inaccuracies or omissions in these explanations is through consistency checking, which typically involves asking follow-up questions. This paper introduces, cross-examiner, a new method for generating follow-up questions based on a model's explanation of an initial question. Our method combines symbolic information extraction with language model-driven question generation, resulting in better follow-up questions than those produced by LLMs alone. Additionally, this approach is more flexible than other methods and can generate a wider variety of follow-up questions.	Computation and Language	[ 11 Mar 2025]

Keeping this in view, this paper focuses on generating a multi-genre Spanish dataset for NLI, ESNLIR, particularly accounting for causal Relationships.

One promising application is investment recommendation. In this paper, we reveal a novel product bias in LLM investment recommendation, where LLMs exhibit systematic preferences for specific products. Such preferences can subtly influence user investment decisions, potentially leading to inflated valuations of products and financial bubbles, posing risks to both individual investors and market stability. To comprehensively study the product bias, we develop an automated pipeline to create a dataset of 567,000 samples across five asset classes (stocks, mutual funds, cryptocurrencies, savings, and portfolios). With this dataset, we present the bf first study on product bias in LLM investment recommendations. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit clear product preferences, such as certain stocks (e.g., `AAPL' from Apple and `MSFT' from Microsoft). Notably, this bias persists even after applying debiasing techniques. We urge AI researchers to take heed of the product bias in LLM investment recommendations and its implications, ensuring fairness and security in the digital space and market.

A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like ""overthinking"" and ""test-time scaling."" This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and test-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks.

However, most prior work evaluates progress using unsupervised proxy metrics with unclear practical relevance. We introduce SAEBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures SAE performance across seven diverse metrics, spanning interpretability, feature disentanglement and practical applications like unlearning. To enable systematic comparison, we open-source a suite of over 200 SAEs across eight recently proposed SAE architectures and training algorithms. Our evaluation reveals that gains on proxy metrics do not reliably translate to better practical performance. For instance, while Matryoshka SAEs slightly underperform on existing proxy metrics, they substantially outperform other architectures on feature disentanglement metrics; moreover, this advantage grows with SAE scale. By providing a standardized framework for measuring progress in SAE development, SAEBench enables researchers to study scaling trends and make nuanced comparisons between different SAE architectures and training methodologies.

However, current single-agent work lacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low efficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking Agents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think about thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical agents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic oversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions. Through iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents explore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent RL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level mathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation studies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent, providing valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.09499	MindGYM: Enhancing Vision-Language Models via Synthetic Self-Challenging Questions	Zhe Xu, Daoyuan Chen, Zhenqing Ling, Yaliang Li, Ying Shen	Large vision-language models (VLMs) face challenges in achieving robust, transferable reasoning abilities due to reliance on labor-intensive manual instruction datasets or computationally expensive self-supervised methods. To address these issues, we introduce MindGYM, a framework that enhances VLMs through synthetic self-challenging questions, consisting of three stages: (1) Seed Single-Hop Question Synthesis, generating cognitive questions across textual (e.g., logical deduction) and multimodal contexts (e.g., diagram-based queries) spanning eight semantic areas like ethical analysis; (2) Challenging Multi-Hop Question Synthesis, combining seed questions via diverse principles like bridging, visual-textual alignment, to create multi-step problems demanding deeper reasoning; and (3) Thinking-Induced Curriculum Fine-Tuning, a structured pipeline that progressively trains the model from scaffolded reasoning to standalone inference. By leveraging the model's self-synthesis capability, MindGYM achieves high data efficiency (e.g., +16% gains on MathVision-Mini with only 400 samples), computational efficiency (reducing both training and inference costs), and robust generalization across tasks. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks demonstrate superior performance over strong baselines, with notable improvements (+15.77% win rates) in reasoning depth and breadth validated via GPT-based scoring. MindGYM underscores the viability of self-challenging for refining VLM capabilities while minimizing human intervention and resource demands.

Our primary focus is on this theoretical realization rather than practical insights derived from experimental data. Finally, we propose solutions to enable thought processes within the feature space and discuss the broader implications of these architectural modifications."	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model	Ali Vosoughi, Dimitra Emmanouilidou, Hannes Gamper	Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

Joosten, Sofia Santiago Fernández, Eric Sancho Adamson, Aleix Solé Sánchez, Marta Soria Heredia	We speak of a \textit{computational law} when that law is intended to be enforced by software through an automated decision-making process. As digital technologies evolve to offer more solutions for public administrations, we see an ever-increasing number of computational laws. Traditionally, law is written in natural language. Computational laws, however, suffer various complications when written in natural language, such as underspecification and ambiguity which lead to a diversity of possible interpretations to be made by the coder. These could potentially result into an uneven application of the law. Thus, resorting to formal languages to write computational laws is tempting. However, writing laws in a formal language leads to further complications, for example, incomprehensibility for non-experts, lack of explicit motivation of the decisions made, or difficulties in retrieving the data leading to the outcome. In this paper, we investigate how certain legal principles fare in both scenarios: computational law written in natural language or written in formal language. We use a running example from the European Union's road transport regulation to showcase the tensions arising, and the benefits from each language.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.09117	GRU: Mitigating the Trade-off between Unlearning and Retention for Large Language Models	Yue Wang, Qizhou Wang, Feng Liu, Wei Huang, Yali Du, Xiaojiang Du, Bo Han	Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated its essential role in removing privacy and copyright-related responses, crucial for their legal and safe applications. However, the pursuit of complete unlearning often comes with substantial costs due to its compromises in their general functionality, leading to a notorious trade-off between unlearning and retention. In examining the update process for unlearning dynamically, we find gradients hold essential information for revealing this trade-off. In particular, we look at the varying relationship between retention performance and directional disparities between gradients during unlearning. It motivates the sculpting of an update mechanism derived from gradients from two sources, i.e., harmful for retention and useful for unlearning. Accordingly, we propose Gradient Rectified Unlearning (GRU), an enhanced unlearning framework controlling the updating gradients in a geometry-focused and optimization-driven manner such that their side impacts on other, unrelated responses can be minimized. Specifically, GRU derives a closed-form solution to project the unlearning gradient onto the orthogonal space of that gradient harmful for retention, ensuring minimal deviation from its original direction under the condition that overall performance is retained. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that GRU, as a general framework, is straightforward to implement and efficiently enhances a range of baseline methods through its adaptable and compatible characteristics. Additionally, experimental results show its broad effectiveness across a diverse set of benchmarks for LLM unlearning.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

Existing approaches struggle to efficiently navigate complex codebases when identifying relevant code sections. The challenge lies in bridging natural language problem descriptions with the appropriate code elements, often requiring reasoning across hierarchical structures and multiple dependencies. We introduce LocAgent, a framework that addresses code localization through graph-based representation. By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures (files, classes, functions) and their dependencies (imports, invocations, inheritance), enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning. Experimental results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances accuracy in code localization. Notably, our method with the fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B model achieves comparable results to SOTA proprietary models at greatly reduced cost (approximately 86% reduction), reaching up to 92.7% accuracy on file-level localization while improving downstream GitHub issue resolution success rates by 12% for multiple attempts (Pass@10).

Krishnan	"Prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), or providing context on the expected model of operation, is an effective way to steer the outputs of such models to satisfy human desiderata after they have been trained. But in rapidly evolving domains, there is often need to fine-tune LLMs to improve either the kind of knowledge in their memory or their abilities to perform open ended reasoning in new domains. When human's learn new concepts, we often do so by linking the new material that we are studying to concepts we have already learned before. To that end, we ask, ""can prompting help us teach LLMs how to learn"". In this work, we study a novel generalization of instruction tuning, called contextual fine-tuning, to fine-tune LLMs. Our method leverages instructional prompts designed to mimic human cognitive strategies in learning and problem-solving to guide the learning process during training, aiming to improve the model's interpretation and understanding of domain-specific knowledge. We empirically demonstrate that this simple yet effective modification improves the ability of LLMs to be fine-tuned rapidly on new datasets both within the medical and financial domains."

Unfortunately, many data catalogs within organizations suffer from limited searchability due to inadequate metadata like asset descriptions. Hence, there is a need of content generation solution to enrich and curate metadata in a scalable way. This paper explores the challenges associated with metadata creation and proposes a unique prompt enrichment idea of leveraging existing metadata content using retrieval based few-shot technique tied with generative large language models (LLM). The literature also considers finetuning an LLM on existing content and studies the behavior of few-shot pretrained LLM (Llama, GPT3.5) vis-à-vis few-shot finetuned LLM (Llama2-7b) by evaluating their performance based on accuracy, factual grounding, and toxicity. Our preliminary results exhibit more than 80% Rouge-1 F1 for the generated content. This implied 87%- 88% of instances accepted as is or curated with minor edits by data stewards. By automatically generating descriptions for tables and columns in most accurate way, the research attempts to provide an overall framework for enterprises to effectively scale metadata curation and enrich its data catalog thereby vastly improving the data catalog searchability and overall usability.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.08990	JBFuzz: Jailbreaking LLMs Efficiently and Effectively Using Fuzzing	Vasudev Gohil	"Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise as language understanding and decision making tools, and they have permeated various aspects of our everyday life. However, their widespread availability also comes with novel risks, such as generating harmful, unethical, or offensive content, via an attack called jailbreaking. Despite extensive efforts from LLM developers to align LLMs using human feedback, they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks. To tackle this issue, researchers often employ red-teaming to understand and investigate jailbreak prompts. However, existing red-teaming approaches lack effectiveness, scalability, or both. To address these issues, we propose JBFuzz, a novel effective, automated, and scalable red-teaming technique for jailbreaking LLMs.
JBFuzz is inspired by the success of fuzzing for detecting bugs/vulnerabilities in software. We overcome three challenges related to effectiveness and scalability by devising novel seed prompts, a lightweight mutation engine, and a lightweight and accurate evaluator for guiding the fuzzer. Assimilating all three solutions results in a potent fuzzer that only requires black-box access to the target LLM. We perform extensive experimental evaluation of JBFuzz using nine popular and widely-used LLMs. We find that JBFuzz successfully jailbreaks all LLMs for various harmful/unethical questions, with an average attack success rate of 99%. We also find that JBFuzz is extremely efficient as it jailbreaks a given LLM for a given question in 60 seconds on average. Our work highlights the susceptibility of the state-of-the-art LLMs to jailbreak attacks even after safety alignment, and serves as a valuable red-teaming tool for LLM developers."

Yuhang Liu, Dong Gong, Erdun Gao, Zhen Zhang, Biwei Huang, Mingming Gong, Anton van den Hengel, Javen Qinfeng Shi	The remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) have led many to conclude that they exhibit a form of intelligence. This is as opposed to explanations of their capabilities based on their ability to perform relatively simple manipulations of vast volumes of data. To illuminate the distinction between these explanations, we introduce a novel generative model that generates tokens on the basis of human interpretable concepts represented as latent discrete variables. Under mild conditions, even when the mapping from the latent space to the observed space is non-invertible, we establish an identifiability result: the representations learned by LLMs through next-token prediction can be approximately modeled as the logarithm of the posterior probabilities of these latent discrete concepts, up to an invertible linear transformation. This theoretical finding not only provides evidence that LLMs capture underlying generative factors, but also strongly reinforces the linear representation hypothesis, which posits that LLMs learn linear representations of human-interpretable concepts. Empirically, we validate our theoretical results through evaluations on both simulation data and the Pythia, Llama, and DeepSeek model families.	Computation and Language	[ 12 Mar 2025]

However, because of the lower diversity of synthetic speech, naively combining synthetic and real data often does not yield the best results. In this work, we leverage recently proposed flow-based TTS/VC models allowing greater speech diversity, and assess the respective impact of augmenting various speech attributes on the word error rate (WER) achieved by several ASR models. Pitch augmentation and VC-based speaker augmentation are found to be ineffective in our setup. Jointly augmenting all other attributes reduces the WER of a Conformer-Transducer model by 11\% relative on Common Voice and by up to 35\% relative on LibriSpeech compared to training on real data only.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.08908	Interpreting the Repeated Token Phenomenon in Large Language Models	Itay Yona, Ilia Shumailov, Jamie Hayes, Federico Barbero, Yossi Gandelsman	Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their impressive capabilities, often fail to accurately repeat a single word when prompted to, and instead output unrelated text. This unexplained failure mode represents a vulnerability, allowing even end-users to diverge models away from their intended behavior. We aim to explain the causes for this phenomenon and link it to the concept of ``attention sinks'', an emergent LLM behavior crucial for fluency, in which the initial token receives disproportionately high attention scores. Our investigation identifies the neural circuit responsible for attention sinks and shows how long repetitions disrupt this circuit. We extend this finding to other non-repeating sequences that exhibit similar circuit disruptions. To address this, we propose a targeted patch that effectively resolves the issue without negatively impacting the model's overall performance. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for an LLM vulnerability, demonstrating how interpretability can diagnose and address issues, and offering insights that pave the way for more secure and reliable models.

Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient and effective strategy to adapt VLMs while preserving their pre-trained knowledge. However, existing methods still lead to overfitting and degrade zero-shot generalization. To address this challenge, we propose an optimal transport (OT)-guided prompt learning framework that mitigates forgetting by preserving the structural consistency of feature distributions between pre-trained and fine-tuned models. Unlike conventional point-wise constraints, OT naturally captures cross-instance relationships and expands the feasible parameter space for prompt tuning, allowing a better trade-off between adaptation and generalization. Our approach enforces joint constraints on both vision and text representations, ensuring a holistic feature alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our simple yet effective method can outperform existing prompt learning strategies in base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization without additional augmentation or ensemble techniques.

In this paper, we investigate spurious bias in MLLMs and introduce SpurLens, a pipeline that leverages GPT-4 and open-set object detectors to automatically identify spurious visual cues without human supervision. Our findings reveal that spurious correlations cause two major failure modes in MLLMs: (1) over-reliance on spurious cues for object recognition, where removing these cues reduces accuracy, and (2) object hallucination, where spurious cues amplify the hallucination by over 10x. We validate our findings in various MLLMs and datasets. Beyond diagnosing these failures, we explore potential mitigation strategies, such as prompt ensembling and reasoning-based prompting, and conduct ablation studies to examine the root causes of spurious bias in MLLMs. By exposing the persistence of spurious correlations, our study calls for more rigorous evaluation methods and mitigation strategies to enhance the reliability of MLLMs.	Computation and Language	[ 11 Mar 2025]

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for automating HDL generation, but existing benchmarks for LLM HDL code generation primarily evaluate functional correctness while overlooking the critical aspect of hardware resource efficiency. Moreover, current benchmarks lack diversity, failing to capture the broad range of real-world FPGA applications. To address these gaps, we introduce ResBench, the first resource-oriented benchmark explicitly designed to differentiate between resource-optimized and inefficient LLM-generated HDL. ResBench consists of 56 problems across 12 categories, covering applications from finite state machines to financial computing. Our evaluation framework systematically integrates FPGA resource constraints, with a primary focus on Lookup Table (LUT) usage, enabling a realistic assessment of hardware efficiency. Experimental results reveal substantial differences in resource utilization across LLMs, demonstrating ResBench's effectiveness in distinguishing models based on their ability to generate resource-optimized FPGA designs.

This phenomenon, known as source bias, threatens the sustainable development of the information access ecosystem. However, the underlying causes of source bias remain unexplored. In this paper, we explain the process of information retrieval with a causal graph and discover that PLM-based retrievers learn perplexity features for relevance estimation, causing source bias by ranking the documents with low perplexity higher. Theoretical analysis further reveals that the phenomenon stems from the positive correlation between the gradients of the loss functions in language modeling task and retrieval task. Based on the analysis, a causal-inspired inference-time debiasing method is proposed, called Causal Diagnosis and Correction (CDC). CDC first diagnoses the bias effect of the perplexity and then separates the bias effect from the overall estimated relevance score. Experimental results across three domains demonstrate the superior debiasing effectiveness of CDC, emphasizing the validity of our proposed explanatory framework.

A key challenge is enabling them to self-correct. While prior research has relied on external tools or large proprietary models, this work explores self-correction in small language models (SLMs) through iterative fine-tuning using solely self-generated data. We introduce the Self-Taught Self-Correction (STaSC) algorithm, which incorporates multiple algorithmic design choices. Experimental results on a question-answering task demonstrate that STaSC effectively learns self-correction, leading to significant performance improvements. Our analysis further provides insights into the mechanisms of self-correction and the impact of different design choices on learning dynamics and overall performance. To support future research, we release our user-friendly codebase and lightweight models.	Computation and Language	[ 11 Mar 2025]

While extensive research has demonstrated these agents' effectiveness in downstream task completion, their reliability in following operational procedures and constraints remains largely unexplored. To this end, we present AgentOrca, a dual-system framework for evaluating language agents' compliance with operational constraints and routines. Our framework encodes action constraints and routines through both natural language prompts for agents and corresponding executable code serving as ground truth for automated verification. Through an automated pipeline of test case generation and evaluation across five real-world domains, we quantitatively assess current language agents' adherence to operational constraints. Our findings reveal notable performance gaps among state-of-the-art models, with large reasoning models like o1 demonstrating superior compliance while others show significantly lower performance, particularly when encountering complex constraints or user persuasion attempts.

However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), interest in this task (in its classical definition) has decreased. In this study, we evaluate the performance of various LLMs on the WSD task. We extend a previous benchmark (XL-WSD) to re-design two subtasks suitable for LLM: 1) given a word in a sentence, the LLM must generate the correct definition; 2) given a word in a sentence and a set of predefined meanings, the LLM must select the correct one. The extended benchmark is built using the XL-WSD and BabelNet. The results indicate that LLMs perform well in zero-shot learning but cannot surpass current state-of-the-art methods. However, a fine-tuned model with a medium number of parameters outperforms all other models, including the state-of-the-art.	Computation and Language	[ 11 Mar 2025]

We empirically study the ability of retrievers to satisfy malicious queries, both when used directly and when used in a retrieval augmented generation-based setup. Concretely, we investigate six leading retrievers, including NV-Embed and LLM2Vec, and find that given malicious requests, most retrievers can (for >50% of queries) select relevant harmful passages. For example, LLM2Vec correctly selects passages for 61.35% of our malicious queries. We further uncover an emerging risk with instruction-following retrievers, where highly relevant harmful information can be surfaced by exploiting their instruction-following capabilities. Finally, we show that even safety-aligned LLMs, such as Llama3, can satisfy malicious requests when provided with harmful retrieved passages in-context. In summary, our findings underscore the malicious misuse risks associated with increasing retriever capability.	Computation and Language	[ 11 Mar 2025]

However, this shifts the computational burden from training-time to inference-time, making deployment of many-shot ICL challenging to justify in-practice. This cost is further increased if a custom demonstration set is retrieved for each inference example. We present Dynamic Block-Sparse Attention, a training-free framework for retrieval-based many-shot in-context learning. By combining carefully designed block-sparse attention and retrieval of cached groups of demonstrations, we achieve comparable per-example latency to finetuning while maintaining on average >95% of the best method's accuracy across strong ICL and finetuning baselines. We hope that this will further enable the deployment of many-shot ICL at scale.	Computation and Language	[ 11 Mar 2025]

While previous datasets relied on published literature, we leverage grant abstracts which offer a unique advantage: they capture claims at an earlier stage in the research lifecycle before publication takes effect. We also introduce a new task to distinguish between existing scientific claims and aspirational research intentions in this http URL zero-shot prompting with frontier large language models, we jointly extract 114K scientific claims and 145K investigation proposals from 16K grant abstracts in the materials science domain to create a focused subset called NSF-SciFy-MatSci. We use this dataset to evaluate 3 three key tasks: (1) technical to non-technical abstract generation, where models achieve high BERTScore (0.85+ F1); (2) scientific claim extraction, where fine-tuned models outperform base models by 100% relative improvement; and (3) investigation proposal extraction, showing 90%+ improvement with fine-tuning. We introduce novel LLM-based evaluation metrics for robust assessment of claim/proposal extraction quality. As the largest scientific claim dataset to date -- with an estimated 2.8 million claims across all STEM disciplines funded by the NSF -- NSF-SciFy enables new opportunities for claim verification and meta-scientific research.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.08588	BiasEdit: Debiasing Stereotyped Language Models via Model Editing	Xin Xu, Wei Xu, Ningyu Zhang, Julian McAuley	Previous studies have established that language models manifest stereotyped biases. Existing debiasing strategies, such as retraining a model with counterfactual data, representation projection, and prompting often fail to efficiently eliminate bias or directly alter the models' biased internal representations. To address these issues, we propose BiasEdit, an efficient model editing method to remove stereotypical bias from language models through lightweight networks that act as editors to generate parameter updates. BiasEdit employs a debiasing loss guiding editor networks to conduct local edits on partial parameters of a language model for debiasing while preserving the language modeling abilities during editing through a retention loss. Experiments on StereoSet and Crows-Pairs demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of BiasEdit in eliminating bias compared to tangental debiasing baselines and little to no impact on the language models' general capabilities. In addition, we conduct bias tracing to probe bias in various modules and explore bias editing impacts on different components of language models.	Computation and Language	[ 11 Mar 2025]

However, existing LLM-based review systems face significant challenges, including limited domain expertise, hallucinated reasoning, and a lack of structured evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepReview, a multi-stage framework designed to emulate expert reviewers by incorporating structured analysis, literature retrieval, and evidence-based argumentation. Using DeepReview-13K, a curated dataset with structured annotations, we train DeepReviewer-14B, which outperforms CycleReviewer-70B with fewer tokens.

Traditional supervised signal-based automatic metrics fail to capture semantic equivalence or handle the variability of open-ended responses, while human evaluation, though reliable, is resource-intensive. Leveraging LLMs as evaluators offers a promising alternative due to their strong language understanding and instruction-following capabilities. Taking advantage of these capabilities, we propose the Dynamic Arbitration Framework for Evaluation (DAFE), which employs two primary LLM-as-judges and engages a third arbitrator only in cases of disagreements. This selective arbitration prioritizes evaluation reliability while reducing unnecessary computational demands compared to conventional majority voting. DAFE utilizes task-specific reference answers with dynamic arbitration to enhance judgment accuracy, resulting in significant improvements in evaluation metrics such as Macro F1 and Cohen's Kappa. Through experiments, including a comprehensive human evaluation, we demonstrate DAFE's ability to provide consistent, scalable, and resource-efficient assessments, establishing it as a robust framework for evaluating free-form model outputs.

Motivated by this, we introduce an open-source, user-friendly toolkit designed to build unified web interfaces for various cascaded and E2E spoken dialogue systems. Our demo further provides users with the option to get on-the-fly automated evaluation metrics such as (1) latency, (2) ability to understand user input, (3) coherence, diversity, and relevance of system response, and (4) intelligibility and audio quality of system output. Using the evaluation metrics, we compare various cascaded and E2E spoken dialogue systems with a human-human conversation dataset as a proxy. Our analysis demonstrates that the toolkit allows researchers to effortlessly compare and contrast different technologies, providing valuable insights such as current E2E systems having poorer audio quality and less diverse responses.

Unlike traditional model compression, which needs retraining, recent dynamic computation methods show that not all components are required for inference, enabling a training-free pipeline. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic depth of LLM generation. A token-position aware layer skipping framework is proposed to save 1.5x times operations efficiently while maintaining performance. We first observed that tokens predicted later have lower perplexity and thus require less computation. Then, we propose a training-free algorithm called Position-Aware Depth Decay Decoding ($D^3$), which leverages a power-law decay function, $\left\lfloor L \times (\alpha^i) \right\rfloor$, to determine the number of layers to retain when generating token $T_i$. Remarkably, without any retraining, the $D^3$ achieves success across a wide range of generation tasks for the first time. Experiments on large language models (\ie the Llama) with $7 \sim 70$ billion parameters show that $D^3$ can achieve an average 1.5x speedup compared with the full-inference pipeline while maintaining comparable performance with nearly no performance drop ($<1\%$) on the GSM8K and BBH benchmarks.

With the increasing volume of academic publications, automating the review process has become a significant challenge. The primary issue lies in generating comprehensive, accurate, and reasoning-consistent review comments that align with human reviewers' judgments. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing ReviewAgents, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate academic paper reviews. We first introduce a novel dataset, Review-CoT, consisting of 142k review comments, designed for training LLM agents. This dataset emulates the structured reasoning process of human reviewers-summarizing the paper, referencing relevant works, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and generating a review conclusion. Building upon this, we train LLM reviewer agents capable of structured reasoning using a relevant-paper-aware training method. Furthermore, we construct ReviewAgents, a multi-role, multi-LLM agent review framework, to enhance the review comment generation process. Additionally, we propose ReviewBench, a benchmark for evaluating the review comments generated by LLMs. Our experimental results on ReviewBench demonstrate that while existing LLMs exhibit a certain degree of potential for automating the review process, there remains a gap when compared to human-generated reviews. Moreover, our ReviewAgents framework further narrows this gap, outperforming advanced LLMs in generating review comments.	Computation and Language	[ 11 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.08495	Enhancing Multi-Hop Fact Verification with Structured Knowledge-Augmented Large Language Models	Han Cao, Lingwei Wei, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu	The rapid development of social platforms exacerbates the dissemination of misinformation, which stimulates the research in fact verification. Recent studies tend to leverage semantic features to solve this problem as a single-hop task. However, the process of verifying a claim requires several pieces of evidence with complicated inner logic and relations to verify the given claim in real-world situations. Recent studies attempt to improve both understanding and reasoning abilities to enhance the performance, but they overlook the crucial relations between entities that benefit models to understand better and facilitate the prediction. To emphasize the significance of relations, we resort to Large Language Models (LLMs) considering their excellent understanding ability. Instead of other methods using LLMs as the predictor, we take them as relation extractors, for they do better in understanding rather than reasoning according to the experimental results. Thus, to solve the challenges above, we propose a novel Structured Knowledge-Augmented LLM-based Network (LLM-SKAN) for multi-hop fact verification. Specifically, we utilize an LLM-driven Knowledge Extractor to capture fine-grained information, including entities and their complicated relations. Besides, we leverage a Knowledge-Augmented Relation Graph Fusion module to interact with each node and learn better claim-evidence representations comprehensively. The experimental results on four common-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our model.	Computation and Language	[ 11 Mar 2025]

However, little attention has been paid to this problem. To bridge this gap, we propose a model named Fidelity-oriented Product Description Generator (FPDG). FPDG takes the entity label of each word into account, since the product attribute information is always conveyed by entity words. Specifically, we first propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) decoder based on the Entity-label-guided Long Short-Term Memory (ELSTM) cell, taking both the embedding and the entity label of each word as input. Second, we establish a keyword memory that stores the entity labels as keys and keywords as values, allowing FPDG to attend to keywords by attending to their entity labels. Experiments conducted on a large-scale real-world product description dataset show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both traditional generation metrics and human evaluations. Specifically, FPDG increases the fidelity of the generated descriptions by 25%.	Computation and Language	[ 11 Mar 2025 (v1), last revised 12 Mar 2025 (this version, v2)]

To achieve this purpose, we use AI auditing methodology that systematically evaluates performance of five LLMs (ChatGPT 4, Llama 3 (70B), Llama 3.1 (405B), Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Google Gemini) using prompts regarding a large set of statements fact-checked by professional journalists (16,513). Specifically, we use topic modeling and regression analysis to investigate which factors (e.g. topic of the prompt or the LLM type) affect evaluations of true, false, and mixed statements. Our findings reveal that while ChatGPT 4 and Google Gemini achieved higher accuracy than other models, overall performance across models remains modest. Notably, the results indicate that models are better at identifying false statements, especially on sensitive topics such as COVID-19, American political controversies, and social issues, suggesting possible guardrails that may enhance accuracy on these topics. The major implication of our findings is that there are significant challenges for using LLMs for factchecking, including significant variation in performance across different LLMs and unequal quality of outputs for specific topics which can be attributed to deficits of training data. Our research highlights the potential and limitations of LLMs in political fact-checking, suggesting potential avenues for further improvements in guardrails as well as fine-tuning.

To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRAG, a RAG framework that is optimized end-to-end by tuning the retriever to capture in-context relevance, enabling adaptation to the diverse and evolving needs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that OpenRAG, by tuning a retriever end-to-end, leads to a consistent improvement of 4.0% over the original retriever, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art retrievers by 2.1%. Additionally, our results indicate that for some tasks, an end-to-end tuned 0.2B retriever can achieve improvements that surpass those of RAG-oriented or instruction-tuned 8B large language models (LLMs), highlighting the cost-effectiveness of our approach in enhancing RAG systems.

We present Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language reasoning process before outputting images. This approach transforms conventional text-to-image generation and editing into a reasoning-guided framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements. We define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets containing over 9M samples with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial relationships. To leverage the advantages of GoT, we implement a unified framework that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning chain generation with an end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by our novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module. Experiments show our GoT framework achieves excellent performance on both generation and editing tasks, with significant improvements over baselines. Additionally, our approach enables interactive visual generation, allowing users to explicitly modify reasoning steps for precise image adjustments. GoT pioneers a new direction for reasoning-driven visual generation and editing, producing images that better align with human intent.

Schwing	Classifier-free guidance has become a staple for conditional generation with denoising diffusion models. However, a comprehensive understanding of classifier-free guidance is still missing. In this work, we carry out an empirical study to provide a fresh perspective on classifier-free guidance. Concretely, instead of solely focusing on classifier-free guidance, we trace back to the root, i.e., classifier guidance, pinpoint the key assumption for the derivation, and conduct a systematic study to understand the role of the classifier. We find that both classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance achieve conditional generation by pushing the denoising diffusion trajectories away from decision boundaries, i.e., areas where conditional information is usually entangled and is hard to learn. Based on this classifier-centric understanding, we propose a generic postprocessing step built upon flow-matching to shrink the gap between the learned distribution for a pre-trained denoising diffusion model and the real data distribution, majorly around the decision boundaries. Experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

This critical absence of semantic information leads commercial LVLMs to either ignore the perturbation entirely or misinterpret its embedded semantics, thereby causing the attack to fail. To overcome these issues, we notice that identifying core semantic objects is a key objective for models trained with various datasets and methodologies. This insight motivates our approach that refines semantic clarity by encoding explicit semantic details within local regions, thus ensuring interoperability and capturing finer-grained features, and by concentrating modifications on semantically rich areas rather than applying them uniformly. To achieve this, we propose a simple yet highly effective solution: at each optimization step, the adversarial image is cropped randomly by a controlled aspect ratio and scale, resized, and then aligned with the target image in the embedding space. Experimental results confirm our hypothesis. Our adversarial examples crafted with local-aggregated perturbations focused on crucial regions exhibit surprisingly good transferability to commercial LVLMs, including GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Claude-3.5-sonnet, Claude-3.7-sonnet, and even reasoning models like o1, Claude-3.7-thinking and Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking.

Addressing the critical challenge of balancing original content preservation with editing task fulfillment, our approach employs a progressive strategy that decomposes complex editing tasks into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Each subtask is controlled through three key synergistic mechanisms: the initial noise, noise added at each denoising step, and cross-attention maps between text prompts and video content. This ensures robust preservation of original video elements while effectively applying the desired edits. Beyond its native video editing capability, we extend V$^2$Edit to 3D scene editing via a ""render-edit-reconstruct"" process, enabling high-quality, 3D-consistent edits even for tasks involving substantial geometric changes such as object insertion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our V$^2$Edit achieves high-quality and successful edits across various challenging video editing tasks and complex 3D scene editing tasks, thereby establishing state-of-the-art performance in both domains."

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10631	HybridVLA: Collaborative Diffusion and Autoregression in a Unified Vision-Language-Action Model	Jiaming Liu, Hao Chen, Pengju An, Zhuoyang Liu, Renrui Zhang, Chenyang Gu, Xiaoqi Li, Ziyu Guo, Sixiang Chen, Mengzhen Liu, Chengkai Hou, Mengdi Zhao, KC alex Zhou, Pheng-Ann Heng, Shanghang Zhang	Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models, enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing autoregressive VLA methods leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they disrupt the continuity of actions. Meanwhile, some VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions, relying solely on VLM-extracted features, which limits their reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates the strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single large language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the generation gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the diffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe, we find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these two predictions, leading to more robust control. In experiments, HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods across various simulation and real-world tasks, including both single-arm and dual-arm robots, while demonstrating stable manipulation in previously unseen configurations.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10630	UniGoal: Towards Universal Zero-shot Goal-oriented Navigation	Hang Yin, Xiuwei Xu, Lingqing Zhao, Ziwei Wang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu	In this paper, we propose a general framework for universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation. Existing zero-shot methods build inference framework upon large language models (LLM) for specific tasks, which differs a lot in overall pipeline and fails to generalize across different types of goal. Towards the aim of universal zero-shot navigation, we propose a uniform graph representation to unify different goals, including object category, instance image and text description. We also convert the observation of agent into an online maintained scene graph. With this consistent scene and goal representation, we preserve most structural information compared with pure text and are able to leverage LLM for explicit graph-based reasoning. Specifically, we conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph at each time instant and propose different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states. The agent first iteratively searches subgraph of goal when zero-matched. With partial matching, the agent then utilizes coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location. Finally scene graph correction and goal verification are applied for perfect matching. We also present a blacklist mechanism to enable robust switch between stages. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three studied navigation tasks with a single model, even outperforming task-specific zero-shot methods and supervised universal methods.

Although adversarial training has been well studied in natural images, its application to biomedical and microscopy data remains limited. Existing self-supervised adversarial training methods overlook the hierarchical structure of histopathology images, where patient-slide-patch relationships provide valuable discriminative signals. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Self-Supervised Adversarial Training (HSAT), which exploits these properties to craft adversarial examples using multi-level contrastive learning and integrate it into adversarial training for enhanced robustness. We evaluate HSAT on multiclass histopathology dataset OpenSRH and the results show that HSAT outperforms existing methods from both biomedical and natural image domains. HSAT enhances robustness, achieving an average gain of 54.31% in the white-box setting and reducing performance drops to 3-4% in the black-box setting, compared to 25-30% for the baseline. These results set a new benchmark for adversarial training in this domain, paving the way for more robust models. Our Code for training and evaluation is available at this https URL.

In this paper, we introduce SciVerse, a multi-modal scientific evaluation benchmark to thoroughly assess LMMs across 5,735 test instances in five distinct versions. We aim to investigate three key dimensions of LMMs: scientific knowledge comprehension, multi-modal content interpretation, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. To unveil whether LMMs possess sufficient scientific expertise, we first transform each problem into three versions containing different levels of knowledge required for solving, i.e., Knowledge-free, -lite, and -rich. Then, to explore how LMMs interpret multi-modal scientific content, we annotate another two versions, i.e., Vision-rich and -only, marking more question information from texts to diagrams. Comparing the results of different versions, SciVerse systematically examines the professional knowledge stock and visual perception skills of LMMs in scientific domains. In addition, to rigorously assess CoT reasoning, we propose a new scientific CoT evaluation strategy, conducting a step-wise assessment on knowledge and logical errors in model outputs. Our extensive evaluation of different LMMs on SciVerse reveals critical limitations in their scientific proficiency and provides new insights into future developments.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10626	NIL: No-data Imitation Learning by Leveraging Pre-trained Video Diffusion Models	Mert Albaba, Chenhao Li, Markos Diomataris, Omid Taheri, Andreas Krause, Michael Black	Acquiring physically plausible motor skills across diverse and unconventional morphologies-including humanoid robots, quadrupeds, and animals-is essential for advancing character simulation and robotics. Traditional methods, such as reinforcement learning (RL) are task- and body-specific, require extensive reward function engineering, and do not generalize well. Imitation learning offers an alternative but relies heavily on high-quality expert demonstrations, which are difficult to obtain for non-human morphologies. Video diffusion models, on the other hand, are capable of generating realistic videos of various morphologies, from humans to ants. Leveraging this capability, we propose a data-independent approach for skill acquisition that learns 3D motor skills from 2D-generated videos, with generalization capability to unconventional and non-human forms. Specifically, we guide the imitation learning process by leveraging vision transformers for video-based comparisons by calculating pair-wise distance between video embeddings. Along with video-encoding distance, we also use a computed similarity between segmented video frames as a guidance reward. We validate our method on locomotion tasks involving unique body configurations. In humanoid robot locomotion tasks, we demonstrate that 'No-data Imitation Learning' (NIL) outperforms baselines trained on 3D motion-capture data. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging generative video models for physically plausible skill learning with diverse morphologies, effectively replacing data collection with data generation for imitation learning.

Recent advances in 3D human reconstruction mainly focus on static human modeling, and the reliance of using synthetic 3D scans for training limits their generalization ability. Conversely, optimization-based video methods achieve higher fidelity but demand controlled capture conditions and computationally intensive refinement processes. Motivated by the emergence of large reconstruction models for efficient static reconstruction, we propose LHM (Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model) to infer high-fidelity avatars represented as 3D Gaussian splatting in a feed-forward pass. Our model leverages a multimodal transformer architecture to effectively encode the human body positional features and image features with attention mechanism, enabling detailed preservation of clothing geometry and texture. To further boost the face identity preservation and fine detail recovery, we propose a head feature pyramid encoding scheme to aggregate multi-scale features of the head regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LHM generates plausible animatable human in seconds without post-processing for face and hands, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10624	ETCH: Generalizing Body Fitting to Clothed Humans via Equivariant Tightness	Boqian Li, Haiwen Feng, Zeyu Cai, Michael J. Black, Yuliang Xiu	Fitting a body to a 3D clothed human point cloud is a common yet challenging task. Traditional optimization-based approaches use multi-stage pipelines that are sensitive to pose initialization, while recent learning-based methods often struggle with generalization across diverse poses and garment types. We propose Equivariant Tightness Fitting for Clothed Humans, or ETCH, a novel pipeline that estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3) equivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface to the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features regress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an inner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show that ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both tightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose clothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%). Our equivariant tightness design can even reduce directional errors by (67.2% ~ 89.8%) in one-shot (or out-of-distribution) settings. Qualitative results demonstrate strong generalization of ETCH, regardless of challenging poses, unseen shapes, loose clothing, and non-rigid dynamics. We will release the code and models soon for research purposes at this https URL.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

One particularly challenging task is autonomous driving, which demands thorough cognitive processing before decisions can be made. In this domain, a sequential and interpretive understanding of visual cues is essential for effective perception, prediction, and planning. Nevertheless, common VQA benchmarks often focus on the accuracy of the final answer while overlooking the reasoning process that enables the generation of accurate responses. Moreover, existing methods lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating step-by-step reasoning in realistic driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DriveLMM-o1, a new dataset and benchmark specifically designed to advance step-wise visual reasoning for autonomous driving. Our benchmark features over 18k VQA examples in the training set and more than 4k in the test set, covering diverse questions on perception, prediction, and planning, each enriched with step-by-step reasoning to ensure logical inference in autonomous driving scenarios. We further introduce a large multimodal model that is fine-tuned on our reasoning dataset, demonstrating robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In addition, we benchmark various open-source and closed-source methods on our proposed dataset, systematically comparing their reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving tasks. Our model achieves a +7.49% gain in final answer accuracy, along with a 3.62% improvement in reasoning score over the previous best open-source model.

We evaluate a range of DiT-based architectures--including PixArt-style and MMDiT variants--and compare them with a standard DiT variant which directly processes concatenated text and noise inputs. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that the performance of standard DiT is comparable with those specialized models, while demonstrating superior parameter-efficiency, especially when scaled up. Leveraging the layer-wise parameter sharing strategy, we achieve a further reduction of 66% in model size compared to an MMDiT architecture, with minimal performance impact. Building on an in-depth analysis of critical components such as text encoders and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), we introduce DiT-Air and DiT-Air-Lite. With supervised and reward fine-tuning, DiT-Air achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval and T2I CompBench, while DiT-Air-Lite remains highly competitive, surpassing most existing models despite its compact size.

However, the existing open-vocabulary tracker is constrained by its framework structure, isolated frame-level perception, and insufficient modal interactions, which hinder its performance in open-vocabulary classification and tracking. In this paper, we propose OVTR (End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking with TRansformer), the first end-to-end open-vocabulary tracker that models motion, appearance, and category simultaneously. To achieve stable classification and continuous tracking, we design the CIP (Category Information Propagation) strategy, which establishes multiple high-level category information priors for subsequent frames. Additionally, we introduce a dual-branch structure for generalization capability and deep multimodal interaction, and incorporate protective strategies in the decoder to enhance performance. Experimental results show that our method surpasses previous trackers on the open-vocabulary MOT benchmark while also achieving faster inference speeds and significantly reducing preprocessing requirements. Moreover, the experiment transferring the model to another dataset demonstrates its strong adaptability. Models and code are released at this https URL.

However, multimodal reasoning, which requires integrating visual and textual information, remains a significant challenge. Existing visual-language models often struggle to effectively analyze and reason visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on complex reasoning tasks. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks hinders the accurate assessment of multimodal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce R1-Onevision, a multimodal reasoning model designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and deep reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a cross-modal reasoning pipeline that transforms images into formal textural representations, enabling precise language-based reasoning. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct the R1-Onevision dataset which provides detailed, step-by-step multimodal reasoning annotations across diverse domains. We further develop the R1-Onevision model through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to cultivate advanced reasoning and robust generalization abilities. To comprehensively evaluate multimodal reasoning performance across different grades, we introduce R1-Onevision-Bench, a benchmark aligned with human educational stages, covering exams from junior high school to university and beyond. Experimental results show that R1-Onevision achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming models such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL on multiple challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

Recent advancements in LoRA-based (Low-Rank Adaptation) methods have shown promise in effectively capturing the style of a single image. However, these approaches still face significant challenges such as content inconsistency, style misalignment, and content leakage. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the limitations of the standard diffusion parameterization, which learns to predict noise, in the context of style transfer. To address these issues, we introduce ConsisLoRA, a LoRA-based method that enhances both content and style consistency by optimizing the LoRA weights to predict the original image rather than noise. We also propose a two-step training strategy that decouples the learning of content and style from the reference image. To effectively capture both the global structure and local details of the content image, we introduce a stepwise loss transition strategy. Additionally, we present an inference guidance method that enables continuous control over content and style strengths during inference. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, our method demonstrates significant improvements in content and style consistency while effectively reducing content leakage.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10613	CoSTA$\ast$: Cost-Sensitive Toolpath Agent for Multi-turn Image Editing	Advait Gupta, NandaKiran Velaga, Dang Nguyen, Tianyi Zhou	"Text-to-image models like stable diffusion and DALLE-3 still struggle with multi-turn image editing. We decompose such a task as an agentic workflow (path) of tool use that addresses a sequence of subtasks by AI tools of varying costs. Conventional search algorithms require expensive exploration to find tool paths. While large language models (LLMs) possess prior knowledge of subtask planning, they may lack accurate estimations of capabilities and costs of tools to determine which to apply in each subtask. Can we combine the strengths of both LLMs and graph search to find cost-efficient tool paths? We propose a three-stage approach ""CoSTA*"" that leverages LLMs to create a subtask tree, which helps prune a graph of AI tools for the given task, and then conducts A* search on the small subgraph to find a tool path. To better balance the total cost and quality, CoSTA* combines both metrics of each tool on every subtask to guide the A* search. Each subtask's output is then evaluated by a vision-language model (VLM), where a failure will trigger an update of the tool's cost and quality on the subtask. Hence, the A* search can recover from failures quickly to explore other paths. Moreover, CoSTA* can automatically switch between modalities across subtasks for a better cost-quality trade-off. We build a novel benchmark of challenging multi-turn image editing, on which CoSTA* outperforms state-of-the-art image-editing models or agents in terms of both cost and quality, and performs versatile trade-offs upon user preference."

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10605	OCCUQ: Exploring Efficient Uncertainty Quantification for 3D Occupancy Prediction	Severin Heidrich, Till Beemelmanns, Alexey Nekrasov, Bastian Leibe, Lutz Eckstein	Autonomous driving has the potential to significantly enhance productivity and provide numerous societal benefits. Ensuring robustness in these safety-critical systems is essential, particularly when vehicles must navigate adverse weather conditions and sensor corruptions that may not have been encountered during training. Current methods often overlook uncertainties arising from adversarial conditions or distributional shifts, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose an efficient adaptation of an uncertainty estimation technique for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method dynamically calibrates model confidence using epistemic uncertainty estimates. Our evaluation under various camera corruption scenarios, such as fog or missing cameras, demonstrates that our approach effectively quantifies epistemic uncertainty by assigning higher uncertainty values to unseen data. We introduce region-specific corruptions to simulate defects affecting only a single camera and validate our findings through both scene-level and region-level assessments. Our results show superior performance in Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection and confidence calibration compared to common baselines such as Deep Ensembles and MC-Dropout. Our approach consistently demonstrates reliable uncertainty measures, indicating its potential for enhancing the robustness of autonomous driving systems in real-world scenarios.

To overcome these challenges, we present MuDG, an innovative framework that integrates Multi-modal Diffusion model with Gaussian Splatting (GS) for Urban Scene Reconstruction. MuDG leverages aggregated LiDAR point clouds with RGB and geometric priors to condition a multi-modal video diffusion model, synthesizing photorealistic RGB, depth, and semantic outputs for novel viewpoints. This synthesis pipeline enables feed-forward NVS without computationally intensive per-scene optimization, providing comprehensive supervision signals to refine 3DGS representations for rendering robustness enhancement under extreme viewpoint changes.

To address the limitations of existing methods in insufficient exploitation of modal synergistic effects, noise sensitivity, and limited fine-grained alignment capabilities, this paper proposes a dual-stage cross-modal alignment framework. First, we construct vision-text and audio-text contrastive learning networks based on an improved CLIP architecture, achieving preliminary alignment in the feature space through modality-decoupled pre-training. Subsequently, we design a temporal-aware dynamic fusion module that combines Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and gated bidirectional LSTM to respectively capture the macro-evolution patterns of facial expressions and local dynamics of acoustic features. Innovatively, we introduce a quality-guided modality fusion strategy that enables modality compensation under occlusion and noisy scenarios through differentiable weight allocation. Experimental results on the Hume-Vidmimic2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.35 across six emotion dimensions, outperforming the best baseline by 40\%. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the dual-stage training strategy and dynamic fusion mechanism, providing a novel technical pathway for fine-grained emotion analysis in open environments.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states, such as hidden states, encode the ""overall truthfulness"" of generated responses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as ""per-token"" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist ""generic truthful directions"" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks.

Previous camera-conditioned video generative models suffer from diminished video dynamics and limited range of viewpoints when generating videos with large camera movement. We take an approach that progressively expands the generation of dynamic scenes -- first enhancing dynamic content within individual video clip, then extending this capability to create seamless explorations across broad viewpoint ranges. Specifically, we construct a dataset featuring a large degree of dynamics with camera parameter annotations for training while designing a lightweight camera injection module and training scheme to preserve dynamics of the pretrained models. Building on these improved single-clip techniques, we enable extended scene exploration by allowing users to iteratively specify camera trajectories for generating coherent video sequences. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that CameraCtrl Ii enables camera-controlled dynamic scene synthesis with substantially wider spatial exploration than previous approaches.

However, real-world narrative videos require multi-shot scenes with visual and dynamic consistency across shots. In this work, we introduce Long Context Tuning (LCT), a training paradigm that expands the context window of pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models to learn scene-level consistency directly from data. Our method expands full attention mechanisms from individual shots to encompass all shots within a scene, incorporating interleaved 3D position embedding and an asynchronous noise strategy, enabling both joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters. Models with bidirectional attention after LCT can further be fine-tuned with context-causal attention, facilitating auto-regressive generation with efficient KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate single-shot models after LCT can produce coherent multi-shot scenes and exhibit emerging capabilities, including compositional generation and interactive shot extension, paving the way for more practical visual content creation.

However, such promotion is extremely dependent on large-scale high-quality annotated data, which is costly and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose unlocking the value of abundant yet unlabeled data to improve the language-driving model in a semi-supervised learning manner. Specifically, we first introduce a series of template-based prompts to extract scene information, generating questions that create pseudo-answers for the unlabeled data based on a model trained with limited labeled data. Next, we propose a Self-Consistency Refinement method to improve the quality of these pseudo-annotations, which are later used for further training. By utilizing a pre-trained VisionLLM (e.g., InternVL), we build a strong Language Driving Model (LDM) for driving scene question-answering, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM benchmark show that our approach performs well with just 5% labeled data, achieving competitive performance against models trained with full datasets. In particular, our LDM achieves 44.85% performance with limited labeled data, increasing to 54.27% when using unlabeled data, while models trained with full datasets reach 60.68% on the DriveLM benchmark.

We propose VisualWebInstruct - a novel approach that leverages search engine to create a diverse, and high-quality dataset spanning multiple disciplines like math, physics, finance, chemistry, etc. Starting with meticulously selected 30,000 seed images, we employ Google Image search to identify websites containing similar images. We collect and process the HTMLs from over 700K unique URL sources. Through a pipeline of content extraction, filtering and synthesis, we build a dataset of approximately 900K question-answer pairs, with 40% being visual QA pairs and the rest as text QA pairs. Models fine-tuned on VisualWebInstruct demonstrate significant performance gains: (1) training from Llava-OV-mid shows 10-20% absolute point gains across benchmarks, (2) training from MAmmoTH-VL shows 5% absoluate gain. Our best model MAmmoTH-VL2 shows state-of-the-art performance within the 10B parameter class on MMMU-Pro-std (40.7%), MathVerse (42.6%), and DynaMath (55.7%). These remarkable results highlight the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing VLMs' reasoning capabilities for complex multimodal tasks.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10579	Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion for LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection	Chaoqun Wang, Xiaobin Hong, Wenzhong Li, Ruimao Zhang	LiDAR-based 3D object detection presents significant challenges due to the inherent sparsity of LiDAR points. A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10568	Autoregressive Image Generation with Randomized Parallel Decoding	Haopeng Li, Jinyue Yang, Guoqi Li, Huan Wang	We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel guided decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.94 with only 64 sampling steps, achieving over a 20-fold increase in throughput while reducing memory consumption by over 75% compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10549	MASQUE: A Text-Guided Diffusion-Based Framework for Localized and Customized Adversarial Makeup	Youngjin Kwon, Xiao Zhang	As facial recognition is increasingly adopted for government and commercial services, its potential misuse has raised serious concerns about privacy and civil rights. To counteract, various anti-facial recognition techniques have been proposed for privacy protection by adversarially perturbing face images, among which generative makeup-based approaches are the most popular. However, these methods, designed primarily to impersonate specific target identities, can only achieve weak dodging success rates while increasing the risk of targeted abuse. In addition, they often introduce global visual artifacts or a lack of adaptability to accommodate diverse makeup prompts, compromising user satisfaction. To address the above limitations, we develop MASQUE, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates localized adversarial makeups guided by user-defined text prompts. Built upon precise null-text inversion, customized cross-attention fusion with masking, and a pairwise adversarial guidance mechanism using images of the same individual, MASQUE achieves robust dodging performance without requiring any external identity. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source facial recognition models and commercial APIs demonstrate that MASQUE significantly improves dodging success rates over all baselines, along with higher perceptual fidelity and stronger adaptability to various text makeup prompts.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10547	Learning Interpretable Logic Rules from Deep Vision Models	Chuqin Geng, Yuhe Jiang, Ziyu Zhao, Haolin Ye, Zhaoyue Wang, Xujie Si	We propose a general framework called VisionLogic to extract interpretable logic rules from deep vision models, with a focus on image classification tasks. Given any deep vision model that uses a fully connected layer as the output head, VisionLogic transforms neurons in the last layer into predicates and grounds them into vision concepts using causal validation. In this way, VisionLogic can provide local explanations for single images and global explanations for specific classes in the form of logic rules. Compared to existing interpretable visualization tools such as saliency maps, VisionLogic addresses several key challenges, including the lack of causal explanations, overconfidence in visualizations, and ambiguity in interpretation. VisionLogic also facilitates the study of visual concepts encoded by predicates, particularly how they behave under perturbation -- an area that remains underexplored in the field of hidden semantics. Apart from providing better visual explanations and insights into the visual concepts learned by the model, we show that VisionLogic retains most of the neural network's discriminative power in an interpretable and transparent manner. We envision it as a bridge between complex model behavior and human-understandable explanations, providing trustworthy and actionable insights for real-world applications.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10530	Lightweight Models for Emotional Analysis in Video	Quoc-Tien Nguyen, Hong-Hai Nguyen, Van-Thong Huynh	In this study, we present an approach for efficient spatiotemporal feature extraction using MobileNetV4 and a multi-scale 3D MLP-Mixer-based temporal aggregation module. MobileNetV4, with its Universal Inverted Bottleneck (UIB) blocks, serves as the backbone for extracting hierarchical feature representations from input image sequences, ensuring both computational efficiency and rich semantic encoding. To capture temporal dependencies, we introduce a three-level MLP-Mixer module, which processes spatial features at multiple resolutions while maintaining structural integrity. Experimental results on the ABAW 8th competition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in affective behavior analysis. By integrating an efficient vision backbone with a structured temporal modeling mechanism, the proposed framework achieves a balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, making it well-suited for real-time applications in mobile and embedded computing environments.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10529	PiSA: A Self-Augmented Data Engine and Training Strategy for 3D Understanding with Large Models	Zilu Guo, Hongbin Lin, Zhihao Yuan, Chaoda Zheng, Pengshuo Qiu, Dongzhi Jiang, Renrui Zhang, Chun-Mei Feng, Zhen Li	3D Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently made substantial advancements. However, their potential remains untapped, primarily due to the limited quantity and suboptimal quality of 3D datasets. Current approaches attempt to transfer knowledge from 2D MLLMs to expand 3D instruction data, but still face modality and domain gaps. To this end, we introduce PiSA-Engine (Point-Self-Augmented-Engine), a new framework for generating instruction point-language datasets enriched with 3D spatial semantics. We observe that existing 3D MLLMs offer a comprehensive understanding of point clouds for annotation, while 2D MLLMs excel at cross-validation by providing complementary information. By integrating holistic 2D and 3D insights from off-the-shelf MLLMs, PiSA-Engine enables a continuous cycle of high-quality data generation. We select PointLLM as the baseline and adopt this co-evolution training framework to develop an enhanced 3D MLLM, termed PointLLM-PiSA. Additionally, we identify limitations in previous 3D benchmarks, which often feature coarse language captions and insufficient category diversity, resulting in inaccurate evaluations. To address this gap, we further introduce PiSA-Bench, a comprehensive 3D benchmark covering six key aspects with detailed and diverse labels. Experimental results demonstrate PointLLM-PiSA's state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot 3D object captioning and generative classification on our PiSA-Bench, achieving significant improvements of 46.45% (+8.33%) and 63.75% (+16.25%), respectively. We will release the code, datasets, and benchmark.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10526	NeighborRetr: Balancing Hub Centrality in Cross-Modal Retrieval	Zengrong Lin, Zheng Wang, Tianwen Qian, Pan Mu, Sixian Chan, Cong Bai	Cross-modal retrieval aims to bridge the semantic gap between different modalities, such as visual and textual data, enabling accurate retrieval across them. Despite significant advancements with models like CLIP that align cross-modal representations, a persistent challenge remains: the hubness problem, where a small subset of samples (hubs) dominate as nearest neighbors, leading to biased representations and degraded retrieval accuracy. Existing methods often mitigate hubness through post-hoc normalization techniques, relying on prior data distributions that may not be practical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we directly mitigate hubness during training and introduce NeighborRetr, a novel method that effectively balances the learning of hubs and adaptively adjusts the relations of various kinds of neighbors. Our approach not only mitigates the hubness problem but also enhances retrieval performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple cross-modal retrieval benchmarks. Furthermore, NeighborRetr demonstrates robust generalization to new domains with substantial distribution shifts, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications. We make our code publicly available at: this https URL .	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10523	Interactive Multimodal Fusion with Temporal Modeling	Jun Yu, Yongqi Wang, Lei Wang, Yang Zheng, Shengfan Xu	This paper presents our method for the estimation of valence-arousal (VA) in the 8th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild (ABAW) competition. Our approach integrates visual and audio information through a multimodal framework. The visual branch uses a pre-trained ResNet model to extract spatial features from facial images. The audio branches employ pre-trained VGG models to extract VGGish and LogMel features from speech signals. These features undergo temporal modeling using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs). We then apply cross-modal attention mechanisms, where visual features interact with audio features through query-key-value attention structures. Finally, the features are concatenated and passed through a regression layer to predict valence and arousal. Our method achieves competitive performance on the Aff-Wild2 dataset, demonstrating effective multimodal fusion for VA estimation in-the-wild.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

Pinto, Jaime S. Cardoso, Arlindo L. Oliveira	Quality control of medical images is a critical component of digital pathology, ensuring that diagnostic images meet required standards. A pre-analytical task within this process is the verification of the number of specimen fragments, a process that ensures that the number of fragments on a slide matches the number documented in the macroscopic report. This step is important to ensure that the slides contain the appropriate diagnostic material from the grossing process, thereby guaranteeing the accuracy of subsequent microscopic examination and diagnosis. Traditionally, this assessment is performed manually, requiring significant time and effort while being subject to significant variability due to its subjective nature. To address these challenges, this study explores an automated approach to fragment counting using the YOLOv9 and Vision Transformer models. Our results demonstrate that the automated system achieves a level of performance comparable to expert assessments, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to manual counting. Additionally, we present findings on interobserver variability, showing that the automated approach achieves an accuracy of 86%, which falls within the range of variation observed among experts (82-88%), further supporting its potential for integration into routine pathology workflows.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10508	Hoi2Anomaly: An Explainable Anomaly Detection Approach Guided by Human-Object Interaction	Yuhan Wang, Cheng Liu, Daou Zhang, Weichao Wu	In the domain of Image Anomaly Detection (IAD), Existing methods frequently exhibit a paucity of fine-grained, interpretable semantic information, resulting in the detection of anomalous entities or activities that are susceptible to machine illusions. This deficiency often leads to the detection of anomalous entities or actions that are susceptible to machine illusions and lack sufficient explanation. In this thesis, we propose a novel approach to anomaly detection, termed Hoi2Anomaly, which aims to achieve precise discrimination and localization of anomalies. The proposed methodology involves the construction of a multi-modal instruction tuning dataset comprising human-object interaction (HOI) pairs in anomalous scenarios. Second, we have trained an HOI extractor in threat scenarios to localize and match anomalous actions and entities. Finally, explanatory content is generated for the detected anomalous HOI by fine-tuning the visual language pretraining (VLP) framework. The experimental results demonstrate that Hoi2Anomaly surpasses existing generative approaches in terms of precision and explainability. We will release Hoi2Anomaly for the advancement of the field of anomaly detection.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10501	TokenCarve: Information-Preserving Visual Token Compression in Multimodal Large Language Models	Xudong Tan, Peng Ye, Chongjun Tu, Jianjian Cao, Yaoxin Yang, Lin Zhang, Dongzhan Zhou, Tao Chen	Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming increasingly popular, while the high computational cost associated with multimodal data input, particularly from visual tokens, poses a significant challenge. Existing training-based token compression methods improve inference efficiency but require costly retraining, while training-free methods struggle to maintain performance when aggressively reducing token counts. In this study, we reveal that the performance degradation of MLLM closely correlates with the accelerated loss of information in the attention output matrix. This insight introduces a novel information-preserving perspective, making it possible to maintain performance even under extreme token compression. Based on this finding, we propose TokenCarve, a training-free, plug-and-play, two-stage token compression framework. The first stage employs an Information-Preservation-Guided Selection (IPGS) strategy to prune low-information tokens, while the second stage further leverages IPGS to guide token merging, minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets and 2 model variants demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenCarve. It can even reduce the number of visual tokens to 22.2% of the original count, achieving a 1.23x speedup in inference, a 64% reduction in KV cache storage, and only a 1.54% drop in accuracy.

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10. To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG. To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results. By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG. Our benchmark, model, and results will be released at this https URL.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10468	OODD: Test-time Out-of-Distribution Detection with Dynamic Dictionary	Yifeng Yang, Lin Zhu, Zewen Sun, Hengyu Liu, Qinying Gu, Nanyang Ye	Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging for deep learning models, particularly when test-time OOD samples differ significantly from training outliers. We propose OODD, a novel test-time OOD detection method that dynamically maintains and updates an OOD dictionary without fine-tuning. Our approach leverages a priority queue-based dictionary that accumulates representative OOD features during testing, combined with an informative inlier sampling strategy for in-distribution (ID) samples. To ensure stable performance during early testing, we propose a dual OOD stabilization mechanism that leverages strategically generated outliers derived from ID data. To our best knowledge, extensive experiments on the OpenOOD benchmark demonstrate that OODD significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 26.0% improvement in FPR95 on CIFAR-100 Far OOD detection compared to the state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, we present an optimized variant of the KNN-based OOD detection framework that achieves a 3x speedup while maintaining detection performance.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10464	Flow-NeRF: Joint Learning of Geometry, Poses, and Dense Flow within Unified Neural Representations	Xunzhi Zheng, Dan Xu	Learning accurate scene reconstruction without pose priors in neural radiance fields is challenging due to inherent geometric ambiguity. Recent development either relies on correspondence priors for regularization or uses off-the-shelf flow estimators to derive analytical poses. However, the potential for jointly learning scene geometry, camera poses, and dense flow within a unified neural representation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Flow-NeRF, a unified framework that simultaneously optimizes scene geometry, camera poses, and dense optical flow all on-the-fly. To enable the learning of dense flow within the neural radiance field, we design and build a bijective mapping for flow estimation, conditioned on pose. To make the scene reconstruction benefit from the flow estimation, we develop an effective feature enhancement mechanism to pass canonical space features to world space representations, significantly enhancing scene geometry. We validate our model across four important tasks, i.e., novel view synthesis, depth estimation, camera pose prediction, and dense optical flow estimation, using several datasets. Our approach surpasses previous methods in almost all metrics for novel-view view synthesis and depth estimation and yields both qualitatively sound and quantitatively accurate novel-view flow.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10450	Consistent multi-animal pose estimation in cattle using dynamic Kalman filter based tracking	Maarten Perneel, Ines Adriaens, Ben Aernouts, Jan Verwaeren	Over the past decade, studying animal behaviour with the help of computer vision has become more popular. Replacing human observers by computer vision lowers the cost of data collection and therefore allows to collect more extensive datasets. However, the majority of available computer vision algorithms to study animal behaviour is highly tailored towards a single research objective, limiting possibilities for data reuse. In this perspective, pose-estimation in combination with animal tracking offers opportunities to yield a higher level representation capturing both the spatial and temporal component of animal behaviour. Such a higher level representation allows to answer a wide variety of research questions simultaneously, without the need to develop repeatedly tailored computer vision algorithms. In this paper, we therefore first cope with several weaknesses of current pose-estimation algorithms and thereafter introduce KeySORT (Keypoint Simple and Online Realtime Tracking). KeySORT deploys an adaptive Kalman filter to construct tracklets in a bounding-box free manner, significantly improving the temporal consistency of detected keypoints. In this paper, we focus on pose estimation in cattle, but our methodology can easily be generalised to any other animal species. Our test results indicate our algorithm is able to detect up to 80% of the ground truth keypoints with high accuracy, with only a limited drop in performance when daylight recordings are compared to nightvision recordings. Moreover, by using KeySORT to construct skeletons, the temporal consistency of generated keypoint coordinates was largely improved, offering opportunities with regard to automated behaviour monitoring of animals.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10440	Learning Disease State from Noisy Ordinal Disease Progression Labels	Gustav Schmidt, Holger Heidrich, Philipp Berens, Sarah Müller	Learning from noisy ordinal labels is a key challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we ask whether ordinal disease progression labels (better, worse, or stable) can be used to learn a representation allowing to classify disease state. For neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), we cast the problem of modeling disease progression between medical visits as a classification task with ordinal ranks. To enhance generalization, we tailor our model to the problem setting by (1) independent image encoding, (2) antisymmetric logit space equivariance, and (3) ordinal scale awareness. In addition, we address label noise by learning an uncertainty estimate for loss re-weighting. Our approach learns an interpretable disease representation enabling strong few-shot performance for the related task of nAMD activity classification from single images, despite being trained only on image pairs with ordinal disease progression labels.

Bagdanov	Exemplar-Free Class Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to learn from a sequence of tasks without having access to previous task data. In this paper, we consider the challenging Cold Start scenario in which insufficient data is available in the first task to learn a high-quality backbone. This is especially challenging for EFCIL since it requires high plasticity, resulting in feature drift which is difficult to compensate for in the exemplar-free setting. To address this problem, we propose an effective approach to consolidate feature representations by regularizing drift in directions highly relevant to previous tasks and employs prototypes to reduce task-recency bias. Our approach, which we call Elastic Feature Consolidation++ (EFC++) exploits a tractable second-order approximation of feature drift based on a proposed Empirical Feature Matrix (EFM). The EFM induces a pseudo-metric in feature space which we use to regularize feature drift in important directions and to update Gaussian prototypes. In addition, we introduce a post-training prototype re-balancing phase that updates classifiers to compensate for feature drift. Experimental results on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-Subset, ImageNet-1K and DomainNet demonstrate that EFC++ is better able to learn new tasks by maintaining model plasticity and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art.

While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations, achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video features, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent, high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings, which then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states, we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both time-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10426	Improving Medical Waste Classification with Hybrid Capsule Networks	Bennet van den Broek, Javad Pourmostafa Roshan Sharami	"The improper disposal and mismanagement of medical waste pose severe environmental and public health risks, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and the spread of infectious diseases. Efficient and accurate medical waste classification is crucial for mitigating these risks. We explore the integration of capsule networks with a pretrained DenseNet model to improve medical waste classification. To the best of our knowledge, capsule networks have not yet been applied to this task, making this study the first to assess their effectiveness.
A diverse dataset of medical waste images collected from multiple public sources, is used to evaluate three model configurations: (1) a pretrained DenseNet model as a baseline, (2) a pretrained DenseNet with frozen layers combined with a capsule network, and (3) a pretrained DenseNet with unfrozen layers combined with a capsule network. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating capsule networks improves classification performance, with F1 scores increasing from 0.89 (baseline) to 0.92 (hybrid model with unfrozen layers). This highlights the potential of capsule networks to address the spatial limitations of traditional convolutional models and improve classification robustness.
While the capsule-enhanced model demonstrated improved classification performance, direct comparisons with prior studies were challenging due to differences in dataset size and diversity. Previous studies relied on smaller, domain-specific datasets, which inherently yielded higher accuracy. In contrast, our study employs a significantly larger and more diverse dataset, leading to better generalization but introducing additional classification challenges. This highlights the trade-off between dataset complexity and model performance."	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10422	Category Prompt Mamba Network for Nuclei Segmentation and Classification	Ye Zhang, Zijie Fang, Yifeng Wang, Lingbo Zhang, Xianchao Guan, Yongbing Zhang	Nuclei segmentation and classification provide an essential basis for tumor immune microenvironment analysis. The previous nuclei segmentation and classification models require splitting large images into smaller patches for training, leading to two significant issues. First, nuclei at the borders of adjacent patches often misalign during inference. Second, this patch-based approach significantly increases the model's training and inference time. Recently, Mamba has garnered attention for its ability to model large-scale images with linear time complexity and low memory consumption. It offers a promising solution for training nuclei segmentation and classification models on full-sized images. However, the Mamba orientation-based scanning method lacks account for category-specific features, resulting in sub-optimal performance in scenarios with imbalanced class distributions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel scanning strategy based on category probability sorting, which independently ranks and scans features for each category according to confidence from high to low. This approach enhances the feature representation of uncertain samples and mitigates the issues caused by imbalanced distributions. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior performance in nuclei segmentation and classification tasks.

Existing roadside perception methods concentrate on model design but overlook data issues like calibration errors, sparse information, and multi-view consistency, leading to poor performance on recent published datasets. To significantly enhance roadside collaborative perception and address critical data issues, we present the first simulation framework RoCo-Sim for road-side collaborative perception. RoCo-Sim is capable of generating diverse, multi-view consistent simulated roadside data through dynamic foreground editing and full-scene style transfer of a single image. RoCo-Sim consists of four components: (1) Camera Extrinsic Optimization ensures accurate 3D to 2D projection for roadside cameras; (2) A novel Multi-View Occlusion-Aware Sampler (MOAS) determines the placement of diverse digital assets within 3D space; (3) DepthSAM innovatively models foreground-background relationships from single-frame fixed-view images, ensuring multi-view consistency of foreground; and (4) Scalable Post-Processing Toolkit generates more realistic and enriched scenes through style transfer and other enhancements. RoCo-Sim significantly improves roadside 3D object detection, outperforming SOTA methods by 83.74 on Rcooper-Intersection and 83.12 on TUMTraf-V2X for AP70. RoCo-Sim fills a critical gap in roadside perception simulation. Code and pre-trained models will be released soon: this https URL	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

While large language models (LLMs) achieve unification through task-agnostic data and generation, existing visual generation models fail to meet these principles. Current approaches either rely on per-task datasets and large-scale training or adapt pre-trained image models with task-specific modifications, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we explore video models as a foundation for unified image generation, leveraging their inherent ability to model temporal correlations. We introduce RealGeneral, a novel framework that reformulates image generation as a conditional frame prediction task, analogous to in-context learning in LLMs. To bridge the gap between video models and condition-image pairs, we propose (1) a Unified Conditional Embedding module for multi-modal alignment and (2) a Unified Stream DiT Block with decoupled adaptive LayerNorm and attention mask to mitigate cross-modal interference. RealGeneral demonstrates effectiveness in multiple important visual generation tasks, e.g., it achieves a 14.5% improvement in subject similarity for customized generation and a 10% enhancement in image quality for canny-to-image task.

Efficiently compressing 3D shapes while preserving intricate geometric details remains a key challenge. Existing 3D shape VAEs often employ uniform point sampling and 1D/2D latent representations, such as vector sets or triplanes, leading to significant geometric detail loss due to inadequate surface coverage and the absence of explicit 3D representations in the latent space. Although recent work explores 3D latent representations, their large scale hinders high-resolution encoding and efficient training. Given these challenges, we introduce Hyper3D, which enhances VAE reconstruction through efficient 3D representation that integrates hybrid triplane and octree features. First, we adopt an octree-based feature representation to embed mesh information into the network, mitigating the limitations of uniform point sampling in capturing geometric distributions along the mesh surface. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid latent space representation that integrates a high-resolution triplane with a low-resolution 3D grid. This design not only compensates for the lack of explicit 3D representations but also leverages a triplane to preserve high-resolution details. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyper3D outperforms traditional representations by reconstructing 3D shapes with higher fidelity and finer details, making it well-suited for 3D generation pipelines.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10399	HSEmotion Team at ABAW-8 Competition: Audiovisual Ambivalence/Hesitancy, Emotional Mimicry Intensity and Facial Expression Recognition	Andrey V. Savchenko	This article presents our results for the eighth Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild (ABAW) competition. We combine facial emotional descriptors extracted by pre-trained models, namely, our EmotiEffLib library, with acoustic features and embeddings of texts recognized from speech. The frame-level features are aggregated and fed into simple classifiers, e.g., multi-layered perceptron (feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer), to predict ambivalence/hesitancy and facial expressions. In the latter case, we also use the pre-trained facial expression recognition model to select high-score video frames and prevent their processing with a domain-specific video classifier. The video-level prediction of emotional mimicry intensity is implemented by simply aggregating frame-level features and training a multi-layered perceptron. Experimental results for three tasks from the ABAW challenge demonstrate that our approach significantly increases validation metrics compared to existing baselines.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10392	RoMA: Scaling up Mamba-based Foundation Models for Remote Sensing	Fengxiang Wang, Hongzhen Wang, Yulin Wang, Di Wang, Mingshuo Chen, Haiyan Zhao, Yangang Sun, Shuo Wang, Long Lan, Wenjing Yang, Jing Zhang	Recent advances in self-supervised learning for Vision Transformers (ViTs) have fueled breakthroughs in remote sensing (RS) foundation models. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to scalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While the linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative, existing RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small, domain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a framework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS foundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances scalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive learning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware pretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to handle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2) multi-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in object scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate that Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance scaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments across scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based counterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The source code and pretrained models will be released at this https URL.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10391	CINEMA: Coherent Multi-Subject Video Generation via MLLM-Based Guidance	Yufan Deng, Xun Guo, Yizhi Wang, Jacob Zhiyuan Fang, Angtian Wang, Shenghai Yuan, Yiding Yang, Bo Liu, Haibin Huang, Chongyang Ma	Video generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of deep generative models, particularly diffusion models. While existing methods excel in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or single images, personalized multi-subject video generation remains a largely unexplored challenge. This task involves synthesizing videos that incorporate multiple distinct subjects, each defined by separate reference images, while ensuring temporal and spatial consistency. Current approaches primarily rely on mapping subject images to keywords in text prompts, which introduces ambiguity and limits their ability to model subject relationships effectively. In this paper, we propose CINEMA, a novel framework for coherent multi-subject video generation by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach eliminates the need for explicit correspondences between subject images and text entities, mitigating ambiguity and reducing annotation effort. By leveraging MLLM to interpret subject relationships, our method facilitates scalability, enabling the use of large and diverse datasets for training. Furthermore, our framework can be conditioned on varying numbers of subjects, offering greater flexibility in personalized content creation. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves subject consistency, and overall video coherence, paving the way for advanced applications in storytelling, interactive media, and personalized video generation.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10371	A Multimodal Fusion Model Leveraging MLP Mixer and Handcrafted Features-based Deep Learning Networks for Facial Palsy Detection	Heng Yim Nicole Oo, Min Hun Lee, Jeong Hoon Lim	Algorithmic detection of facial palsy offers the potential to improve current practices, which usually involve labor-intensive and subjective assessments by clinicians. In this paper, we present a multimodal fusion-based deep learning model that utilizes an MLP mixer-based model to process unstructured data (i.e. RGB images or images with facial line segments) and a feed-forward neural network to process structured data (i.e. facial landmark coordinates, features of facial expressions, or handcrafted features) for detecting facial palsy. We then contribute to a study to analyze the effect of different data modalities and the benefits of a multimodal fusion-based approach using videos of 20 facial palsy patients and 20 healthy subjects. Our multimodal fusion model achieved 96.00 F1, which is significantly higher than the feed-forward neural network trained on handcrafted features alone (82.80 F1) and an MLP mixer-based model trained on raw RGB images (89.00 F1).

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10365	Piece it Together: Part-Based Concepting with IP-Priors	Elad Richardson, Kfir Goldberg, Yuval Alaluf, Daniel Cohen-Or	Advanced generative models excel at synthesizing images but often rely on text-based conditioning. Visual designers, however, often work beyond language, directly drawing inspiration from existing visual elements. In many cases, these elements represent only fragments of a potential concept-such as an uniquely structured wing, or a specific hairstyle-serving as inspiration for the artist to explore how they can come together creatively into a coherent whole. Recognizing this need, we introduce a generative framework that seamlessly integrates a partial set of user-provided visual components into a coherent composition while simultaneously sampling the missing parts needed to generate a plausible and complete concept. Our approach builds on a strong and underexplored representation space, extracted from IP-Adapter+, on which we train IP-Prior, a lightweight flow-matching model that synthesizes coherent compositions based on domain-specific priors, enabling diverse and context-aware generations. Additionally, we present a LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy that significantly improves prompt adherence in IP-Adapter+ for a given task, addressing its common trade-off between reconstruction quality and prompt adherence.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10358	ConceptGuard: Continual Personalized Text-to-Image Generation with Forgetting and Confusion Mitigation	Zirun Guo, Tao Jin	Diffusion customization methods have achieved impressive results with only a minimal number of user-provided images. However, existing approaches customize concepts collectively, whereas real-world applications often require sequential concept integration. This sequential nature can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned concepts are lost. In this paper, we investigate concept forgetting and concept confusion in the continual customization. To tackle these challenges, we present ConceptGuard, a comprehensive approach that combines shift embedding, concept-binding prompts and memory preservation regularization, supplemented by a priority queue which can adaptively update the importance and occurrence order of different concepts. These strategies can dynamically update, unbind and learn the relationship of the previous concepts, thus alleviating concept forgetting and confusion. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our approach outperforms all the baseline methods consistently and significantly in both quantitative and qualitative analyses.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10356	Object detection characteristics in a learning factory environment using YOLOv8	Toni Schneidereit, Stefan Gohrenz, Michael Breuß	AI-based object detection, and efforts to explain and investigate their characteristics, is a topic of high interest. The impact of, e.g., complex background structures with similar appearances as the objects of interest, on the detection accuracy and, beforehand, the necessary dataset composition are topics of ongoing research. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of background influences and different features of the object to be detected. The latter includes various materials and surfaces, partially transparent and with shiny reflections in the context of an Industry 4.0 learning factory. Different YOLOv8 models have been trained for each of the materials on different sized datasets, where the appearance was the only changing parameter. In the end, similar characteristics tend to show different behaviours and sometimes unexpected results. While some background components tend to be detected, others with the same features are not part of the detection. Additionally, some more precise conclusions can be drawn from the results. Therefore, we contribute a challenging dataset with detailed investigations on 92 trained YOLO models, addressing some issues on the detection accuracy and possible overfitting.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10350	Enhancing Facial Privacy Protection via Weakening Diffusion Purification	Ali Salar, Qing Liu, Yingli Tian, Guoying Zhao	The rapid growth of social media has led to the widespread sharing of individual portrait images, which pose serious privacy risks due to the capabilities of automatic face recognition (AFR) systems for mass surveillance. Hence, protecting facial privacy against unauthorized AFR systems is essential. Inspired by the generation capability of the emerging diffusion models, recent methods employ diffusion models to generate adversarial face images for privacy protection. However, they suffer from the diffusion purification effect, leading to a low protection success rate (PSR). In this paper, we first propose learning unconditional embeddings to increase the learning capacity for adversarial modifications and then use them to guide the modification of the adversarial latent code to weaken the diffusion purification effect. Moreover, we integrate an identity-preserving structure to maintain structural consistency between the original and generated images, allowing human observers to recognize the generated image as having the same identity as the original. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets, i.e., CelebA-HQ and LADN, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The protected faces generated by our method outperform those produced by existing facial privacy protection approaches in terms of transferability and natural appearance.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10342	DreamInsert: Zero-Shot Image-to-Video Object Insertion from A Single Image	Qi Zhao, Zhan Ma, Pan Zhou	Recent developments in generative diffusion models have turned many dreams into realities. For video object insertion, existing methods typically require additional information, such as a reference video or a 3D asset of the object, to generate the synthetic motion. However, inserting an object from a single reference photo into a target background video remains an uncharted area due to the lack of unseen motion information. We propose DreamInsert, which achieves Image-to-Video Object Insertion in a training-free manner for the first time. By incorporating the trajectory of the object into consideration, DreamInsert can predict the unseen object movement, fuse it harmoniously with the background video, and generate the desired video seamlessly. More significantly, DreamInsert is both simple and effective, achieving zero-shot insertion without end-to-end training or additional fine-tuning on well-designed image-video data pairs. We demonstrated the effectiveness of DreamInsert through a variety of experiments. Leveraging this capability, we present the first results for Image-to-Video object insertion in a training-free manner, paving exciting new directions for future content creation and synthesis. The code will be released soon.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10331	OSMa-Bench: Evaluating Open Semantic Mapping Under Varying Lighting Conditions	Maxim Popov, Regina Kurkova, Mikhail Iumanov, Jaafar Mahmoud, Sergey Kolyubin	Open Semantic Mapping (OSM) is a key technology in robotic perception, combining semantic segmentation and SLAM techniques. This paper introduces a dynamically configurable and highly automated LLM/LVLM-powered pipeline for evaluating OSM solutions called OSMa-Bench (Open Semantic Mapping Benchmark). The study focuses on evaluating state-of-the-art semantic mapping algorithms under varying indoor lighting conditions, a critical challenge in indoor environments. We introduce a novel dataset with simulated RGB-D sequences and ground truth 3D reconstructions, facilitating the rigorous analysis of mapping performance across different lighting conditions. Through experiments on leading models such as ConceptGraphs, BBQ and OpenScene, we evaluate the semantic fidelity of object recognition and segmentation. Additionally, we introduce a Scene Graph evaluation method to analyze the ability of models to interpret semantic structure. The results provide insights into the robustness of these models, forming future research directions for developing resilient and adaptable robotic systems. Our code is available at this https URL.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10324	IDEA: Inverted Text with Cooperative Deformable Aggregation for Multi-modal Object Re-Identification	Yuhao Wang, Yongfeng Lv, Pingping Zhang, Huchuan Lu	Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to retrieve specific objects by utilizing complementary information from various modalities. However, existing methods focus on fusing heterogeneous visual features, neglecting the potential benefits of text-based semantic information. To address this issue, we first construct three text-enhanced multi-modal object ReID benchmarks. To be specific, we propose a standardized multi-modal caption generation pipeline for structured and concise text annotations with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Besides, current methods often directly aggregate multi-modal information without selecting representative local features, leading to redundancy and high complexity. To address the above issues, we introduce IDEA, a novel feature learning framework comprising the Inverted Multi-modal Feature Extractor (IMFE) and Cooperative Deformable Aggregation (CDA). The IMFE utilizes Modal Prefixes and an InverseNet to integrate multi-modal information with semantic guidance from inverted text. The CDA adaptively generates sampling positions, enabling the model to focus on the interplay between global features and discriminative local features. With the constructed benchmarks and the proposed modules, our framework can generate more robust multi-modal features under complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal object ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10322	Towards Fast, Memory-based and Data-Efficient Vision-Language Policy	Haoxuan Li, Sixu Yan, Yuhan Li, Xinggang Wang	Vision Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on Internet-scale vision-language data have demonstrated the potential to transfer their knowledge to robotic learning. However, the existing paradigm encounters three critical challenges: (1) expensive inference cost resulting from large-scale model parameters, (2) frequent domain shifts caused by mismatched data modalities, and (3) limited capacity to handle past or future experiences. In this work, we propose LiteVLP, a lightweight, memory-based, and general-purpose vision-language policy generation model. LiteVLP is built upon a pre-trained 1B-parameter VLM and fine-tuned on a tiny-scale and conversation-style robotic dataset. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LiteVLP outperforms state-of-the-art vision-language policy on VIMA-Bench, with minimal training time. Furthermore, LiteVLP exhibits superior inference speed while maintaining exceptional high accuracy. In long-horizon manipulation tasks, LiteVLP also shows remarkable memory ability, outperforming the best-performing baseline model by 18.8%. These results highlight LiteVLP as a promising model to integrating the intelligence of VLMs into robotic learning.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10307	6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation	Georgy Ponimatkin, Martin Cífka, Tomáš Souček, Médéric Fourmy, Yann Labbé, Vladimir Petrik, Josef Sivic	We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.

Efficient segmentation methods are needed to automate this process while maintaining high accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that utilizes eye-tracking data from Aria glasses to generate prompt points, which are then used to produce segmentation masks via a fast zero-shot segmentation model. Additionally, we apply post-processing to refine the prompts, leading to improved segmentation quality. Through our approach, we demonstrate that combining eye-tracking-based annotation with smart prompt refinement can enhance segmentation accuracy, achieving an improvement of 70.6% from 38.8 to 66.2 in the Jaccard Index for segmentation results in the rats dataset.

Specifically, our model improves the reasoning performance of three types of MLLMs and four different model scales. Even when applied to the highly capable InternVL2.5-78B, it achieves a 5.9-point improvement across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that our model exhibits superior performance compared to Outcome Reward Models and Self-Consistency during BoN evaluation. To facilitate the training of multimodal PRMs, we construct a multimodal process supervision dataset VisualPRM400K using an automated data pipeline. For the evaluation of multimodal PRMs, we propose VisualProcessBench, a benchmark with human-annotated step-wise correctness labels, to measure the abilities of PRMs to detect erroneous steps in multimodal reasoning tasks. We hope that our work can inspire more future research and contribute to the development of MLLMs. Our model, data, and benchmark are released in this https URL.

In this paper, we present MaterialMVP, a novel end-to-end model for generating PBR textures from 3D meshes and image prompts, addressing key challenges in multi-view material synthesis. Our approach leverages Reference Attention to extract and encode informative latent from the input reference images, enabling intuitive and controllable texture generation. We also introduce a Consistency-Regularized Training strategy to enforce stability across varying viewpoints and illumination conditions, ensuring illumination-invariant and geometrically consistent results. Additionally, we propose Dual-Channel Material Generation, which separately optimizes albedo and metallic-roughness (MR) textures while maintaining precise spatial alignment with the input images through Multi-Channel Aligned Attention. Learnable material embeddings are further integrated to capture the distinct properties of albedo and MR. Experimental results demonstrate that our model generates PBR textures with realistic behavior across diverse lighting scenarios, outperforming existing methods in both consistency and quality for scalable 3D asset creation.

The core of our method lies in a novel transformer-based network architecture. In particular, our model starts with an image encoder that maps each image to a list of visual tokens. All visual tokens are concatenated with additional inserted learnable camera tokens. The obtained tokens then fully communicate with each other within a tailored transformer decoder. The camera tokens causally aggregate features from visual tokens of different views, and further modulate them frame-wisely to inject view-dependent features. 3D Gaussian splats and camera pose parameters can then be estimated via different prediction heads. Experiments show that VicaSplat surpasses baseline methods for multi-view inputs, and achieves comparable performance to prior two-view approaches. Remarkably, VicaSplat also demonstrates exceptional cross-dataset generalization capability on the ScanNet benchmark, achieving superior performance without any fine-tuning.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10270	EEdit : Rethinking the Spatial and Temporal Redundancy for Efficient Image Editing	Zexuan Yan, Yue Ma, Chang Zou, Wenteng Chen, Qifeng Chen, Linfeng Zhang	Inversion-based image editing is rapidly gaining momentum while suffering from significant computation overhead, hindering its application in real-time interactive scenarios. In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10262	A Multi-Modal Federated Learning Framework for Remote Sensing Image Classification	Barış Büyüktaş, Gencer Sumbul, Begüm Demir	Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients) without sharing the local data of the clients. Most of the existing FL methods assume that the data distributed across all clients is associated with the same data modality. However, remote sensing (RS) images present in different clients can be associated with diverse data modalities. The joint use of the multi-modal RS data can significantly enhance classification performance. To effectively exploit decentralized and unshared multi-modal RS data, our paper introduces a novel multi-modal FL framework for RS image classification problems. The proposed framework comprises three modules: 1) multi-modal fusion (MF); 2) feature whitening (FW); and 3) mutual information maximization (MIM). The MF module employs iterative model averaging to facilitate learning without accessing multi-modal training data on clients. The FW module aims to address the limitations of training data heterogeneity by aligning data distributions across clients. The MIM module aims to model mutual information by maximizing the similarity between images from different modalities. For the experimental analyses, we focus our attention on multi-label classification and pixel-based classification tasks in RS. The results obtained using two benchmark archives show the effectiveness of the proposed framework when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. The code of the proposed framework will be available at this https URL.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10259	KVQ: Boosting Video Quality Assessment via Saliency-guided Local Perception	Yunpeng Qu, Kun Yuan, Qizhi Xie, Ming Sun, Chao Zhou, Jian Wang	Video Quality Assessment (VQA), which intends to predict the perceptual quality of videos, has attracted increasing attention. Due to factors like motion blur or specific distortions, the quality of different regions in a video varies. Recognizing the region-wise local quality within a video is beneficial for assessing global quality and can guide us in adopting fine-grained enhancement or transcoding strategies. Due to the heavy cost of annotating region-wise quality, the lack of ground truth constraints from relevant datasets further complicates the utilization of local perception. Inspired by the Human Visual System (HVS) that links global quality to the local texture of different regions and their visual saliency, we propose a Kaleidoscope Video Quality Assessment (KVQ) framework, which aims to effectively assess both saliency and local texture, thereby facilitating the assessment of global quality. Our framework extracts visual saliency and allocates attention using Fusion-Window Attention (FWA) while incorporating a Local Perception Constraint (LPC) to mitigate the reliance of regional texture perception on neighboring areas. KVQ obtains significant improvements across multiple scenarios on five VQA benchmarks compared to SOTA methods. Furthermore, to assess local perception, we establish a new Local Perception Visual Quality (LPVQ) dataset with region-wise annotations. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of KVQ in perceiving local distortions. KVQ models and the LPVQ dataset will be available at this https URL.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10256	ROODI: Reconstructing Occluded Objects with Denoising Inpainters	Yeonjin Chang, Erqun Dong, Seunghyeon Seo, Nojun Kwak, Kwang Moo Yi	While the quality of novel-view images has improved dramatically with 3D Gaussian Splatting, extracting specific objects from scenes remains challenging. Isolating individual 3D Gaussian primitives for each object and handling occlusions in scenes remain far from being solved. We propose a novel object extraction method based on two key principles: (1) being object-centric by pruning irrelevant primitives; and (2) leveraging generative inpainting to compensate for missing observations caused by occlusions. For pruning, we analyze the local structure of primitives using K-nearest neighbors, and retain only relevant ones. For inpainting, we employ an off-the-shelf diffusion-based inpainter combined with occlusion reasoning, utilizing the 3D representation of the entire scene. Our findings highlight the crucial synergy between pruning and inpainting, both of which significantly enhance extraction performance. We evaluate our method on a standard real-world dataset and introduce a synthetic dataset for quantitative analysis. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, demonstrating its effectiveness in object extraction from complex scenes.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10252	SVIP: Semantically Contextualized Visual Patches for Zero-Shot Learning	Zhi Chen, Zecheng Zhao, Jingcai Guo, Jingjing Li, Zi Huang	Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes without labeled training examples by leveraging class-level semantic descriptors such as attributes. A fundamental challenge in ZSL is semantic misalignment, where semantic-unrelated information involved in visual features introduce ambiguity to visual-semantic interaction. Unlike existing methods that suppress semantic-unrelated information post hoc either in the feature space or the model space, we propose addressing this issue at the input stage, preventing semantic-unrelated patches from propagating through the network. To this end, we introduce Semantically contextualized VIsual Patches (SVIP) for ZSL, a transformer-based framework designed to enhance visual-semantic alignment. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised patch selection mechanism that preemptively learns to identify semantic-unrelated patches in the input space. This is trained with the supervision from aggregated attention scores across all transformer layers, which estimate each patch's semantic score. As removing semantic-unrelated patches from the input sequence may disrupt object structure, we replace them with learnable patch embeddings. With initialization from word embeddings, we can ensure they remain semantically meaningful throughout feature extraction. Extensive experiments on ZSL benchmarks demonstrate that SVIP achieves state-of-the-art performance results while providing more interpretable and semantically rich feature representations.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10247	Interpretable Image Classification via Non-parametric Part Prototype Learning	Zhijie Zhu, Lei Fan, Maurice Pagnucco, Yang Song	Classifying images with an interpretable decision-making process is a long-standing problem in computer vision. In recent years, Prototypical Part Networks has gained traction as an approach for self-explainable neural networks, due to their ability to mimic human visual reasoning by providing explanations based on prototypical object parts. However, the quality of the explanations generated by these methods leaves room for improvement, as the prototypes usually focus on repetitive and redundant concepts. Leveraging recent advances in prototype learning, we present a framework for part-based interpretable image classification that learns a set of semantically distinctive object parts for each class, and provides diverse and comprehensive explanations. The core of our method is to learn the part-prototypes in a non-parametric fashion, through clustering deep features extracted from foundation vision models that encode robust semantic information. To quantitatively evaluate the quality of explanations provided by ProtoPNets, we introduce Distinctiveness Score and Comprehensiveness Score. Through evaluation on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and Stanford Dogs datasets, we show that our framework compares favourably against existing ProtoPNets while achieving better interpretability.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10225	Unveiling the Invisible: Reasoning Complex Occlusions Amodally with AURA	Zhixuan Li, Hyunse Yoon, Sanghoon Lee, Weisi Lin	Amodal segmentation aims to infer the complete shape of occluded objects, even when the occluded region's appearance is unavailable. However, current amodal segmentation methods lack the capability to interact with users through text input and struggle to understand or reason about implicit and complex purposes. While methods like LISA integrate multi-modal large language models (LLMs) with segmentation for reasoning tasks, they are limited to predicting only visible object regions and face challenges in handling complex occlusion scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task named amodal reasoning segmentation, aiming to predict the complete amodal shape of occluded objects while providing answers with elaborations based on user text input. We develop a generalizable dataset generation pipeline and introduce a new dataset focusing on daily life scenarios, encompassing diverse real-world occlusions. Furthermore, we present AURA (Amodal Understanding and Reasoning Assistant), a novel model with advanced global and spatial-level designs specifically tailored to handle complex occlusions. Extensive experiments validate AURA's effectiveness on the proposed dataset. The code, model, and dataset will be publicly released.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

However, existing methods rely on deterministic decision-making, struggling to generalize across the large anatomical and procedural variations inherent in real-world this http URL this paper, we introduce an innovative framework that incorporates stochastic modeling through a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) into conventional deterministic learning for surgical workflow analysis. At the heart of our approach is a collaborative co-training paradigm: the DDPM branch captures procedural uncertainties to enrich feature representations, while the task branch focuses on predicting surgical phases and instrument this http URL, we demonstrate that this mutual refinement mechanism benefits both branches: the DDPM reduces prediction errors in uncertain scenarios, and the task branch directs the DDPM toward clinically meaningful representations. Notably, the DDPM branch is discarded during inference, enabling real-time predictions without sacrificing this http URL on the Cholec80 dataset show that for the anticipation task, our method achieves a 16% reduction in eMAE compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and for phase recognition, it improves the Jaccard score by 1.0%.

The more challenging Few-shot CIL (FSCIL) setting further complicates this by providing only a limited number of samples for each new class, increasing the risk of overfitting in addition to standard CIL challenges. While catastrophic forgetting has been extensively studied, overfitting in FSCIL, especially with large foundation models, has received less attention. To fill this gap, we propose the Singular Value Fine-tuning for FSCIL (SVFCL) and compared it with existing approaches for adapting foundation models to FSCIL, which primarily build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like prompt tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Specifically, SVFCL applies singular value decomposition to the foundation model weights, keeping the singular vectors fixed while fine-tuning the singular values for each task, and then merging them. This simple yet effective approach not only alleviates the forgetting problem but also mitigates overfitting more effectively while significantly reducing trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, along with visualizations and ablation studies, validate the effectiveness of SVFCL. The code will be made available.

Traditional machine vision approaches, despite their ability to detect spontaneous behaviors, fall short due to limited interpretability and reliance on manual labeling, which restricts the exploration of the full behavioral spectrum. Here, we introduce MouseGPT, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that integrates visual cues with natural language to revolutionize mouse behavior analysis. Built upon our first-of-its-kind dataset - incorporating pose dynamics and open-vocabulary behavioral annotations across over 42 million frames of diverse psychiatric conditions - MouseGPT provides a novel, context-rich method for comprehensive behavior interpretation. Our holistic analysis framework enables detailed behavior profiling, clustering, and novel behavior discovery, offering deep insights without the need for labor - intensive manual annotation. Evaluations reveal that MouseGPT surpasses existing models in precision, adaptability, and descriptive richness, positioning it as a transformative tool for ethology and for unraveling complex behavioral dynamics in animal models.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10210	TARS: Traffic-Aware Radar Scene Flow Estimation	Jialong Wu, Marco Braun, Dominic Spata, Matthias Rottmann	Scene flow provides crucial motion information for autonomous driving. Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel $\textbf{T}$raffic-$\textbf{A}$ware $\textbf{R}$adar $\textbf{S}$cene flow estimation method, named $\textbf{TARS}$, which utilizes the motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. Therefrom, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space, enabling a holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.

Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools (e.g., search engine, memory banks, OCR, retrieval models) to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our methodology consists of four key steps: 1. Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2. Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos, improving the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3. Action: Agents answer long video-related questions and exchange reasons. 4. Reflection: We evaluate the performance of each agent in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (including GPT-4o) and open-source models (including InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, on the LongVideoBench dataset, LVAgent improves accuracy by up to 14.3% compared with SOTA.

However, the performance of SNN models is often constrained, limiting their application in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel neural network architecture, ST-FlowNet, specifically tailored for optical flow estimation from event-based data. The ST-FlowNet architecture integrates ConvGRU modules to facilitate cross-modal feature augmentation and temporal alignment of the predicted optical flow, improving the network's ability to capture complex motion dynamics. Additionally, to overcome the challenges associated with training SNNs, we introduce a novel approach to derive SNN models from pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) through ANN-to-SNN conversion or our proposed BISNN method. Notably, the BISNN method alleviates the complexities involved in biological parameter selection, further enhancing the robustness of SNNs in optical flow estimation tasks. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark event-based datasets demonstrate that the SNN-based ST-FlowNet model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior performance in accurate optical flow estimation across a diverse range of dynamic visual scenes. Furthermore, the inherent energy efficiency of SNN models is highlighted, establishing a compelling advantage for their practical deployment. Overall, our work presents a novel framework for optical flow estimation using SNNs and event-based data, contributing to the advancement of neuromorphic vision applications.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10183	Through the Magnifying Glass: Adaptive Perception Magnification for Hallucination-Free VLM Decoding	Shunqi Mao, Chaoyi Zhang, Weidong Cai	Existing vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucination, where the generated responses contain inaccuracies that are not grounded in the visual input. Efforts to address this issue without model finetuning primarily mitigate hallucination by reducing biases contrastively or amplifying the weights of visual embedding during decoding. However, these approaches improve visual perception at the cost of impairing the language reasoning capability. In this work, we propose the Perception Magnifier (PM), a novel visual decoding method that iteratively isolates relevant visual tokens based on attention and magnifies the corresponding regions, spurring the model to concentrate on fine-grained visual details during decoding. Specifically, by magnifying critical regions while preserving the structural and contextual information at each decoding step, PM allows the VLM to enhance its scrutiny of the visual input, hence producing more accurate and faithful responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PM not only achieves superior hallucination mitigation but also enhances language generation while preserving strong reasoning this http URL is available at this https URL .

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10152	A Hierarchical Semantic Distillation Framework for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection	Shenghao Fu, Junkai Yan, Qize Yang, Xihan Wei, Xiaohua Xie, Wei-Shi Zheng	Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) aims to detect objects beyond the training annotations, where detectors are usually aligned to a pre-trained vision-language model, eg, CLIP, to inherit its generalizable recognition ability so that detectors can recognize new or novel objects. However, previous works directly align the feature space with CLIP and fail to learn the semantic knowledge effectively. In this work, we propose a hierarchical semantic distillation framework named HD-OVD to construct a comprehensive distillation process, which exploits generalizable knowledge from the CLIP model in three aspects. In the first hierarchy of HD-OVD, the detector learns fine-grained instance-wise semantics from the CLIP image encoder by modeling relations among single objects in the visual space. Besides, we introduce text space novel-class-aware classification to help the detector assimilate the highly generalizable class-wise semantics from the CLIP text encoder, representing the second hierarchy. Lastly, abundant image-wise semantics containing multi-object and their contexts are also distilled by an image-wise contrastive distillation. Benefiting from the elaborated semantic distillation in triple hierarchies, our HD-OVD inherits generalizable recognition ability from CLIP in instance, class, and image levels. Thus, we boost the novel AP on the OV-COCO dataset to 46.4% with a ResNet50 backbone, which outperforms others by a clear margin. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to analyze how each component works.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

However, current methods fall short in achieving this level of generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UGP, a pruned framework designed to enhance generalization power for LiDAR point cloud registration. The core insight in UGP is the elimination of cross-attention mechanisms to improve generalization, allowing the network to concentrate on intra-frame feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a progressive self-attention module to reduce ambiguity in large-scale scenes and integrate Bird's Eye View (BEV) features to incorporate semantic information about scene elements. Together, these enhancements significantly boost the network's generalization performance. We validated our approach through various generalization experiments in multiple outdoor scenes. In cross-distance generalization experiments on KITTI and nuScenes, UGP achieved state-of-the-art mean Registration Recall rates of 94.5% and 91.4%, respectively. In cross-dataset generalization from nuScenes to KITTI, UGP achieved a state-of-the-art mean Registration Recall of 90.9%. Code will be available at this https URL.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10148	3D Student Splatting and Scooping	Jialin Zhu, Jiangbei Yue, Feixiang He, He Wang	Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provides a new framework for novel view synthesis, and has spiked a new wave of research in neural rendering and related applications. As 3DGS is becoming a foundational component of many models, any improvement on 3DGS itself can bring huge benefits. To this end, we aim to improve the fundamental paradigm and formulation of 3DGS. We argue that as an unnormalized mixture model, it needs to be neither Gaussians nor splatting. We subsequently propose a new mixture model consisting of flexible Student's t distributions, with both positive (splatting) and negative (scooping) densities. We name our model Student Splatting and Scooping, or SSS. When providing better expressivity, SSS also poses new challenges in learning. Therefore, we also propose a new principled sampling approach for optimization. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, across multiple datasets, settings, and metrics, we demonstrate that SSS outperforms existing methods in terms of quality and parameter efficiency, e.g. achieving matching or better quality with similar numbers of components, and obtaining comparable results while reducing the component number by as much as 82%.

Current training paradigms with 3D tone mapping often result in unstable HDR reconstruction, while training with 2D tone mapping reduces the model's capacity to fit LDR images. Additionally, the global tone mapper used in existing methods can impede the learning of both HDR and LDR representations. To address these challenges, we present GaussHDR, which unifies 3D and 2D local tone mapping through 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we design a residual local tone mapper for both 3D and 2D tone mapping that accepts an additional context feature as input. We then propose combining the dual LDR rendering results from both 3D and 2D local tone mapping at the loss level. Finally, recognizing that different scenes may exhibit varying balances between the dual results, we introduce uncertainty learning and use the uncertainties for adaptive modulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussHDR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

It has also been used to measure leaf area index and total leaf area. Some studies have used hand-held cameras, image processing 3D reconstruction and unsupervised learning-based methods to estimate the leaf area in plant images. Deep learning works well for object detection and segmentation tasks; however, direct area estimation of objects has not been explored. This work investigates deep learning-based leaf area estimation, for RGBD images taken using a mobile camera setup in real-world scenarios. A dataset for attached leaves captured with a top angle view and a dataset for detached single leaves were collected for model development and testing. First, image processing-based area estimation was tested on manually segmented leaves. Then a Mask R-CNN-based model was investigated, and modified to accept RGBD images and to estimate the leaf area. The detached-leaf data set was then mixed with the attached-leaf plant data set to estimate the single leaf area for plant images, and another network design with two backbones was proposed: one for segmentation and the other for area estimation. Instead of trying all possibilities or random values, an agile approach was used in hyperparameter tuning. The final model was cross-validated with 5-folds and tested with two unseen datasets: detached and attached leaves. The F1 score with 90% IoA for segmentation result on unseen detached-leaf data was 1.0, while R-squared of area estimation was 0.81. For unseen plant data segmentation, the F1 score with 90% IoA was 0.59, while the R-squared score was 0.57. The research suggests using attached leaves with ground truth area to improve the results.

Unlike previous diffusion-based models that treat layout planning and layout-to-image as two separate models, PlanGen jointly models the two tasks into one autoregressive transformer using only next-token prediction. PlanGen integrates layout conditions into the model as context without requiring specialized encoding of local captions and bounding box coordinates, which provides significant advantages over the previous embed-and-pool operations on layout conditions, particularly when dealing with complex layouts. Unified prompting allows PlanGen to perform multitasking training related to layout, including layout planning, layout-to-image generation, image layout understanding, etc. In addition, PlanGen can be seamlessly expanded to layout-guided image manipulation thanks to the well-designed modeling, with teacher-forcing content manipulation policy and negative layout guidance. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our PlanGen in multiple layoutrelated tasks, showing its great potential. Code is available at: this https URL.

Despite their strong performance in general T2I tasks, our research reveals that these models initially struggle with subject-driven image generation compared to dominant diffusion models. To address this limitation, we introduce Proxy-Tuning, leveraging diffusion models to enhance AR models' capabilities in subject-specific image generation. Our method reveals a striking weak-to-strong phenomenon: fine-tuned AR models consistently outperform their diffusion model supervisors in both subject fidelity and prompt adherence. We analyze this performance shift and identify scenarios where AR models excel, particularly in multi-subject compositions and contextual understanding. This work not only demonstrates impressive results in subject-driven AR image generation, but also unveils the potential of weak-to-strong generalization in the image generation domain, contributing to a deeper understanding of different architectures' strengths and limitations.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10120	Hybrid Agents for Image Restoration	Bingchen Li, Xin Li, Yiting Lu, Zhibo Chen	Existing Image Restoration (IR) studies typically focus on task-specific or universal modes individually, relying on the mode selection of users and lacking the cooperation between multiple task-specific/universal restoration modes. This leads to insufficient interaction for unprofessional users and limits their restoration capability for complicated real-world applications. In this work, we present HybridAgent, intending to incorporate multiple restoration modes into a unified image restoration model and achieve intelligent and efficient user interaction through our proposed hybrid agents. Concretely, we propose the hybrid rule of fast, slow, and feedback restoration agents. Here, the slow restoration agent optimizes the powerful multimodal large language model (MLLM) with our proposed instruction-tuning dataset to identify degradations within images with ambiguous user prompts and invokes proper restoration tools accordingly. The fast restoration agent is designed based on a lightweight large language model (LLM) via in-context learning to understand the user prompts with simple and clear requirements, which can obviate the unnecessary time/resource costs of MLLM. Moreover, we introduce the mixed distortion removal mode for our HybridAgents, which is crucial but not concerned in previous agent-based works. It can effectively prevent the error propagation of step-by-step image restoration and largely improve the efficiency of the agent system. We validate the effectiveness of HybridAgent with both synthetic and real-world IR tasks.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

Efficient and precise editing of these images is critical for these applications. With the advent of Stable Diffusion (SD), high-quality image generation and editing have entered a new era. However, existing methods often struggle to consider each object both individually and part of the whole image editing, both of which are crucial for ensuring consistent quantity perception, resulting in suboptimal perceptual performance. To address these challenges, we propose MoEdit, an auxiliary-free multi-object image editing framework. MoEdit facilitates high-quality multi-object image editing in terms of style transfer, object reinvention, and background regeneration, while ensuring consistent quantity perception between inputs and outputs, even with a large number of objects. To achieve this, we introduce the Feature Compensation (FeCom) module, which ensures the distinction and separability of each object attribute by minimizing the in-between interlacing. Additionally, we present the Quantity Attention (QTTN) module, which perceives and preserves quantity consistency by effective control in editing, without relying on auxiliary tools. By leveraging the SD model, MoEdit enables customized preservation and modification of specific concepts in inputs with high quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our MoEdit achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance in multi-object image editing. Data and codes will be available at this https URL.

In this work, we introduce the first benchmark for Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) to overcome these limitations. Our analysis reveals that current TVR methods based on pre-trained models struggle to retain plasticity when adapting to new tasks, while existing continual learning approaches experience catastrophic forgetting, resulting in semantic misalignment between historical queries and stored video features. To address these challenges, we propose StableFusion, a novel CTVR framework comprising two main components: the Frame Fusion Adapter (FFA), which captures temporal dynamics in video content while preserving model flexibility, and the Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (TAME), which maintains consistent semantic alignment between queries across tasks and the stored video features. Comprehensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets under various task settings demonstrate that StableFusion outperforms existing continual learning and TVR methods, achieving superior retrieval performance with minimal degradation on earlier tasks in the context of continuous video streams.

However, images captured by diverse sensors often encounter various degradations that can negatively affect fusion quality. Traditional fusion methods generally treat image enhancement and fusion as separate processes, overlooking the inherent correlation between them; notably, the dominant regions in one modality of a fused image often indicate areas where the other modality might benefit from enhancement. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the concept of dominant regions for image enhancement and present a Dynamic Relative EnhAnceMent framework for Image Fusion (Dream-IF). This framework quantifies the relative dominance of each modality across different layers and leverages this information to facilitate reciprocal cross-modal enhancement. By integrating the relative dominance derived from image fusion, our approach supports not only image restoration but also a broader range of image enhancement applications. Furthermore, we employ prompt-based encoding to capture degradation-specific details, which dynamically steer the restoration process and promote coordinated enhancement in both multi-modal image fusion and image enhancement scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Dream-IF consistently outperforms its counterparts.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

Emotion modeling based on the Valence-Arousal (VA) space enables a more nuanced representation of emotional states. However, existing methods still face challenges in handling long-term dependencies and capturing complex temporal dynamics. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel emotion recognition model, Mamba-VA, which leverages the Mamba architecture to efficiently model sequential emotional variations in video frames. First, the model employs a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to extract deep visual features from video frames, enhancing the robustness of temporal information. Then, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is utilized for temporal modeling to capture local temporal dependencies. Subsequently, Mamba is applied for long-sequence modeling, enabling the learning of global emotional trends. Finally, a fully connected (FC) layer performs regression analysis to predict continuous valence and arousal values. Experimental results on the Valence-Arousal (VA) Estimation task of the 8th competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) demonstrate that the proposed model achieves valence and arousal scores of 0.5362 (0.5036) and 0.4310 (0.4119) on the validation (test) set, respectively, outperforming the baseline.

However, the inherently iterative nature of diffusion-based inverse algorithms often requires hundreds to thousands of steps, with performance degradation occurring under fewer steps which limits their practical applicability. While high-order diffusion ODE solvers have been extensively explored for efficient diffusion sampling without observations, their application to inverse problems remains underexplored due to the diverse forms of inverse algorithms and their need for repeated trajectory correction based on observations. To address this gap, we first introduce a canonical form that decomposes existing diffusion-based inverse algorithms into three modules to unify their analysis. Inspired by the linear subspace search strategy in the design of high-order diffusion ODE solvers, we propose the Learnable Linear Extrapolation (LLE) method, a lightweight approach that universally enhances the performance of any diffusion-based inverse algorithm that fits the proposed canonical form. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements of the proposed LLE method across multiple algorithms and tasks, indicating its potential for more efficient solutions and boosted performance of diffusion-based inverse algorithms with limited steps.

The thicknesses are predicted by a convolutional neural network that leverages the external quantum efficiency of a perovskite solar cell. The network is trained in thickness ranges where the optical properties are constant, and these ranges set the constraints for the network's application. Due to light sensitivity issues with opaque perovskites, the convolutional neural network showed better performance with transparent perovskites. To optimize the performance and reduce the root mean square error, we tried different sampling methods, image specifications, and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. While sampling methods showed marginal improvement, implementing Bayesian optimization demonstrated high accuracy. Other minor optimization attempts include experimenting with input specifications and pre-processing approaches. The results confirm the feasibility, efficiency, and effectiveness of a convolution neural network for predicting perovskite solar cells' layer thicknesses based on controlled experiments.

However, existing methods rely heavily on human priors and pre-trained generation models, which may introduce unrealistic motion and lead to inefficient inference. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Latent Motion (SeMo), a compact and expressive motion representation. Leveraging this representation, our approach achieve both high-quality visual results and efficient inference. SeMo follows an effective three-step framework: Abstraction, Reasoning, and Generation. First, in the Abstraction step, we use a carefully designed Mask Motion Encoder to compress the subject's motion state into a compact and abstract latent motion (1D token). Second, in the Reasoning step, long-term modeling and efficient reasoning are performed in this latent space to generate motion sequences. Finally, in the Generation step, the motion dynamics serve as conditional information to guide the generation model in synthesizing realistic transitions from reference frames to target frames. Thanks to the compact and descriptive nature of Semantic Latent Motion, our method enables real-time video generation with highly realistic motion. User studies demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models with an 81% win rate in realism. Extensive experiments further highlight its strong compression capability, reconstruction quality, and generative potential. Moreover, its fully self-supervised nature suggests promising applications in broader video generation tasks.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

In particular, we assume malicious adversaries exploiting diffusion models for inpainting tasks, such as replacing a specific region with a celebrity. While existing methods for protecting images from manipulation in diffusion-based generative models have primarily focused on image-to-image and text-to-image tasks, the challenge of preventing unauthorized inpainting has been rarely addressed, often resulting in suboptimal protection performance. To mitigate inpainting abuses, we propose ADVPAINT, a novel defensive framework that generates adversarial perturbations that effectively disrupt the adversary's inpainting tasks. ADVPAINT targets the self- and cross-attention blocks in a target diffusion inpainting model to distract semantic understanding and prompt interactions during image generation. ADVPAINT also employs a two-stage perturbation strategy, dividing the perturbation region based on an enlarged bounding box around the object, enhancing robustness across diverse masks of varying shapes and sizes. Our experimental results demonstrate that ADVPAINT's perturbations are highly effective in disrupting the adversary's inpainting tasks, outperforming existing methods; ADVPAINT attains over a 100-point increase in FID and substantial decreases in precision.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10080	Bayesian Prompt Flow Learning for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection	Zhen Qu, Xian Tao, Xinyi Gong, Shichen Qu, Qiyu Chen, Zhengtao Zhang, Xingang Wang, Guiguang Ding	Recently, vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). By leveraging auxiliary data during training, these models can directly perform cross-category anomaly detection on target datasets, such as detecting defects on industrial product surfaces or identifying tumors in organ tissues. Existing approaches typically construct text prompts through either manual design or the optimization of learnable prompt vectors. However, these methods face several challenges: 1) handcrafted prompts require extensive expert knowledge and trial-and-error; 2) single-form learnable prompts struggle to capture complex anomaly semantics; and 3) an unconstrained prompt space limit generalization to unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose Bayesian Prompt Flow Learning (Bayes-PFL), which models the prompt space as a learnable probability distribution from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, a prompt flow module is designed to learn both image-specific and image-agnostic distributions, which are jointly utilized to regularize the text prompt space and enhance the model's generalization on unseen categories. These learned distributions are then sampled to generate diverse text prompts, effectively covering the prompt space. Additionally, a residual cross-attention (RCA) module is introduced to better align dynamic text embeddings with fine-grained image features. Extensive experiments on 15 industrial and medical datasets demonstrate our method's superior performance.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

However, with the development of communication protocols, the visual data consumption volume of machines has gradually surpassed that of humans. For machines, the preference depends on downstream tasks such as segmentation and detection, rather than visual appeal. Considering the huge gap between human and machine visual systems, this paper proposes the topic: Image Quality Assessment for Machine Vision for the first time. Specifically, we (1) defined the subjective preferences of machines, including downstream tasks, test models, and evaluation metrics; (2) established the Machine Preference Database (MPD), which contains 2.25M fine-grained annotations and 30k reference/distorted image pair instances; (3) verified the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on MPD. Experiments show that current IQA metrics are human-centric and cannot accurately characterize machine preferences. We sincerely hope that MPD can promote the evolution of IQA from human to machine preferences. Project page is on: this https URL.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

Specifically, there are two key issues: 1) current motion metrics do not fully align with human perceptions; 2) the existing motion prompts are limited. Based on these findings, we introduce VMBench--a comprehensive Video Motion Benchmark that has perception-aligned motion metrics and features the most diverse types of motion. VMBench has several appealing properties: 1) Perception-Driven Motion Evaluation Metrics, we identify five dimensions based on human perception in motion video assessment and develop fine-grained evaluation metrics, providing deeper insights into models' strengths and weaknesses in motion quality. 2) Meta-Guided Motion Prompt Generation, a structured method that extracts meta-information, generates diverse motion prompts with LLMs, and refines them through human-AI validation, resulting in a multi-level prompt library covering six key dynamic scene dimensions. 3) Human-Aligned Validation Mechanism, we provide human preference annotations to validate our benchmarks, with our metrics achieving an average 35.3% improvement in Spearman's correlation over baseline methods. This is the first time that the quality of motion in videos has been evaluated from the perspective of human perception alignment. Additionally, we will soon release VMBench at this https URL, setting a new standard for evaluating and advancing motion generation models.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

However, due to the lack of early and disease-specific symptoms, most patients with PDAC are diagnosed at an advanced disease stage. Consequently, early PDAC detection is crucial for improving patients' quality of life and expanding treatment options. In this work, we develop a coarse-to-fine approach to detect PDAC on contrast-enhanced CT scans. First, we localize and crop the region of interest from the low-resolution images, and then segment the PDAC-related structures at a finer scale. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further boost detection performance: (1) a data-splitting strategy for model ensembling, and (2) a customized post-processing function. We participated in the PANORAMA challenge and ranked 1st place for PDAC detection with an AUROC of 0.9263 and an AP of 0.7243. Our code and models are publicly available at this https URL.

Traditional single-modality approaches often fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by radiological and pathological assessments. In this work, we introduce M4Survive (Multi-Modal Mamba Modeling for Survival Prediction), a novel framework that learns joint foundation model representations using efficient adapter networks. Our approach dynamically fuses heterogeneous embeddings from a foundation model repository (e.g., MedImageInsight, BiomedCLIP, Prov-GigaPath, UNI2-h), creating a correlated latent space optimized for survival risk estimation. By leveraging Mamba-based adapters, M4Survive enables efficient multi-modal learning while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms both unimodal and traditional static multi-modal baselines in survival prediction accuracy. This work underscores the potential of foundation model-driven multi-modal fusion in advancing precision oncology and predictive analytics.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10055	Fourier Decomposition for Explicit Representation of 3D Point Cloud Attributes	Donghyun Kim, Hyunah Ko, Chanyoung Kim, Seong Jae Hwang	While 3D point clouds are widely utilized across various vision applications, their irregular and sparse nature make them challenging to handle. In response, numerous encoding approaches have been proposed to capture the rich semantic information of point clouds. Yet, a critical limitation persists: a lack of consideration for colored point clouds which are more capable 3D representations as they contain diverse attributes: color and geometry. While existing methods handle these attributes separately on a per-point basis, this leads to a limited receptive field and restricted ability to capture relationships across multiple points. To address this, we pioneer a point cloud encoding methodology that leverages 3D Fourier decomposition to disentangle color and geometric features while extending the receptive field through spectral-domain operations. Our analysis confirms that this encoding approach effectively separates feature components, where the amplitude uniquely captures color attributes and the phase encodes geometric structure, thereby enabling independent learning and utilization of both attributes. Furthermore, the spectral-domain properties of these components naturally aggregate local features while considering multiple points' information. We validate our point cloud encoding approach on point cloud classification and style transfer tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the DensePoint dataset with improvements via a proposed amplitude-based data augmentation strategy.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10052	DTA: Dual Temporal-channel-wise Attention for Spiking Neural Networks	Minje Kim, Minjun Kim, Xu Yang	Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) present a more energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by harnessing spatio-temporal dynamics and event-driven spikes. Effective utilization of temporal information is crucial for SNNs, leading to the exploration of attention mechanisms to enhance this capability. Conventional attention operations either apply identical operation or employ non-identical operations across target dimensions. We identify that these approaches provide distinct perspectives on temporal information. To leverage the strengths of both operations, we propose a novel Dual Temporal-channel-wise Attention (DTA) mechanism that integrates both identical/non-identical attention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to concentrate on both the correlation and dependency of temporal-channel using both identical and non-identical attention operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the DTA mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance on both static datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-1k) and dynamic dataset (CIFAR10-DVS), elevating spike representation and capturing complex temporal-channel relationship. We open-source our code: this https URL.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10049	Enhancing Multi-Agent Systems via Reinforcement Learning with LLM-based Planner and Graph-based Policy	Ziqi Jia, Junjie Li, Xiaoyang Qu, Jianzong Wang	Multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown great potential in executing complex tasks, but coordination and safety remain significant challenges. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising framework for agent collaboration, but it faces difficulties in handling complex tasks and designing reward functions. The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought stronger reasoning and cognitive abilities to MAS, but existing LLM-based systems struggle to respond quickly and accurately in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-based Graph Collaboration MARL (LGC-MARL), a framework that efficiently combines LLMs and MARL. This framework decomposes complex tasks into executable subtasks and achieves efficient collaboration among multiple agents through graph-based coordination. Specifically, LGC-MARL consists of two main components: an LLM planner and a graph-based collaboration meta policy. The LLM planner transforms complex task instructions into a series of executable subtasks, evaluates the rationality of these subtasks using a critic model, and generates an action dependency graph. The graph-based collaboration meta policy facilitates communication and collaboration among agents based on the action dependency graph, and adapts to new task environments through meta-learning. Experimental results on the AI2-THOR simulation platform demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of LGC-MARL in completing various complex tasks.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10043	FourierSR: A Fourier Token-based Plugin for Efficient Image Super-Resolution	Wenjie Li, Heng Guo, Yuefeng Hou, Zhanyu Ma	Image super-resolution (SR) aims to recover low-resolution images to high-resolution images, where improving SR efficiency is a high-profile challenge. However, commonly used units in SR, like convolutions and window-based Transformers, have limited receptive fields, making it challenging to apply them to improve SR under extremely limited computational cost. To address this issue, inspired by modeling convolution theorem through token mix, we propose a Fourier token-based plugin called FourierSR to improve SR uniformly, which avoids the instability or inefficiency of existing token mix technologies when applied as plug-ins. Furthermore, compared to convolutions and windows-based Transformers, our FourierSR only utilizes Fourier transform and multiplication operations, greatly reducing complexity while having global receptive fields. Experimental results show that our FourierSR as a plug-and-play unit brings an average PSNR gain of 0.34dB for existing efficient SR methods on Manga109 test set at the scale of x4, while the average increase in the number of Params and FLOPs is only 0.6% and 1.5% of original sizes. We will release our codes upon acceptance.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10042	How Do Multimodal Large Language Models Handle Complex Multimodal Reasoning? Placing Them in An Extensible Escape Game	Ziyue Wang, Yurui Dong, Fuwen Luo, Minyuan Ruan, Zhili Cheng, Chi Chen, Peng Li, Yang Liu	The rapid advancing of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred interest in complex multimodal reasoning tasks in the real-world and virtual environment, which require coordinating multiple abilities, including visual perception, visual reasoning, spatial awareness, and target deduction. However, existing evaluations primarily assess the final task completion, often degrading assessments to isolated abilities such as visual grounding and visual question answering. Less attention is given to comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing reasoning process in multimodal environments, which is crucial for understanding model behaviors and underlying reasoning mechanisms beyond merely task success. To address this, we introduce MM-Escape, an extensible benchmark for investigating multimodal reasoning, inspired by real-world escape games. MM-Escape emphasizes intermediate model behaviors alongside final task completion. To achieve this, we develop EscapeCraft, a customizable and open environment that enables models to engage in free-form exploration for assessing multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments show that MLLMs, regardless of scale, can successfully complete the simplest room escape tasks, with some exhibiting human-like exploration strategies. Yet, performance dramatically drops as task difficulty increases. Moreover, we observe that performance bottlenecks vary across models, revealing distinct failure modes and limitations in their multimodal reasoning abilities, such as repetitive trajectories without adaptive exploration, getting stuck in corners due to poor visual spatial awareness, and ineffective use of acquired props, such as the key. We hope our work sheds light on new challenges in multimodal reasoning, and uncovers potential improvements in MLLMs capabilities.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

Through systematic investigation, we discover this limitation stems from distributional biases rather than inherent model constraints. Our key insight reveals that while models fail on rare compositions when their inversions are common, they can successfully generate similar intermediate compositions (e.g., ""mouse chasing boy""). To test this hypothesis, we develop a Role-Bridging Decomposition framework that leverages these intermediates to gradually teach rare relationships without architectural modifications. We introduce ActionBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate action-based relationship generation across stereotypical and counter-stereotypical configurations. Our experiments validate that intermediate compositions indeed facilitate counter-stereotypical generation, with both automatic metrics and human evaluations showing significant improvements over existing approaches. This work not only identifies fundamental biases in current text-to-image systems but demonstrates a promising direction for addressing them through compositional reasoning."

Zhao, Letian Gao, Zewei Zhou, Tianhui Cai, Yun Zhang, Jiaqi Ma	Cooperative perception enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication holds significant promise for enhancing the perception capabilities of autonomous vehicles, allowing them to overcome occlusions and extend their field of view. However, existing research predominantly relies on simulated environments or static datasets, leaving the feasibility and effectiveness of V2X cooperative perception especially for intermediate fusion in real-world scenarios largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce V2X-ReaLO, an open online cooperative perception framework deployed on real vehicles and smart infrastructure that integrates early, late, and intermediate fusion methods within a unified pipeline and provides the first practical demonstration of online intermediate fusion's feasibility and performance under genuine real-world conditions. Additionally, we present an open benchmark dataset specifically designed to assess the performance of online cooperative perception systems. This new dataset extends V2X-Real dataset to dynamic, synchronized ROS bags and provides 25,028 test frames with 6,850 annotated key frames in challenging urban scenarios. By enabling real-time assessments of perception accuracy and communication lantency under dynamic conditions, V2X-ReaLO sets a new benchmark for advancing and optimizing cooperative perception systems in real-world applications. The codes and datasets will be released to further advance the field.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

Yang, Sina Poorghasem	Rapid response to natural disasters such as earthquakes is a crucial element in ensuring the safety of civil infrastructures and minimizing casualties. Traditional manual inspection is labour-intensive, time-consuming, and can be dangerous for inspectors and rescue workers. This paper proposed an autonomous inspection approach for structural damage inspection and survivor detection in the post-disaster building indoor scenario, which incorporates an autonomous navigation method, deep learning-based damage and survivor detection method, and a customized low-cost micro aerial vehicle (MAV) with onboard sensors. Experimental studies in a pseudo-post-disaster office building have shown the proposed methodology can achieve high accuracy in structural damage inspection and survivor detection. Overall, the proposed inspection approach shows great potential to improve the efficiency of existing manual post-disaster building inspection.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.10020	One-Shot Federated Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Scaled Entropy Attention and Multi-Source Smoothed Pseudo Labeling	Ali Abedi, Q. M. Jonathan Wu, Ning Zhang, Farhad Pourpanah	Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach for privacy-preserving collaborative learning. However, it faces significant challenges when dealing with domain shifts, especially when each client has access only to its source data and cannot share it during target domain adaptation. Moreover, FL methods often require high communication overhead due to multiple rounds of model updates between clients and the server. We propose a one-shot Federated Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (FUDA) method to address these limitations. Specifically, we introduce Scaled Entropy Attention (SEA) for model aggregation and Multi-Source Pseudo Labeling (MSPL) for target domain adaptation. SEA uses scaled prediction entropy on target domain to assign higher attention to reliable models. This improves the global model quality and ensures balanced weighting of contributions. MSPL distills knowledge from multiple source models to generate pseudo labels and manage noisy labels using smoothed soft-label cross-entropy (SSCE). Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four standard benchmarks while reducing communication and computation costs, making it highly suitable for real-world applications. The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

MASt3R redefines image matching as a 3D task by leveraging DUSt3R and introducing a fast reciprocal matching scheme that accelerates matching by orders of magnitude while preserving theoretical guarantees. This approach has gained strong traction, with DUSt3R and MASt3R collectively cited over 250 times in a short span, underscoring their impact. However, despite its accuracy, MASt3R's inference speed remains a bottleneck. On an A40 GPU, latency per image pair is 198.16 ms, mainly due to computational overhead from the ViT encoder-decoder and Fast Reciprocal Nearest Neighbor (FastNN) matching.
To address this, we introduce Speedy MASt3R, a post-training optimization framework that enhances inference efficiency while maintaining accuracy. It integrates multiple optimization techniques, including FlashMatch-an approach leveraging FlashAttention v2 with tiling strategies for improved efficiency, computation graph optimization via layer and tensor fusion having kernel auto-tuning with TensorRT (GraphFusion), and a streamlined FastNN pipeline that reduces memory access time from quadratic to linear while accelerating block-wise correlation scoring through vectorized computation (FastNN-Lite). Additionally, it employs mixed-precision inference with FP16/FP32 hybrid computations (HybridCast), achieving speedup while preserving numerical precision. Evaluated on Aachen Day-Night, InLoc, 7-Scenes, ScanNet1500, and MegaDepth1500, Speedy MASt3R achieves a 54% reduction in inference time (198 ms to 91 ms per image pair) without sacrificing accuracy.

While grid-based representations are widely adopted for their efficiency and scalability, the existing feature grids with linear indexing for continuous-space points can only provide degenerate linear latent space representations, and such representations cannot be adequately compensated to represent complex nonlinear signals by the following compact decoder. To address this problem while keeping the simplicity of a regular grid structure, our approach builds upon the standard grid-based paradigm by constructing multiple elementary metric grids as high-order terms to approximate complex nonlinearities, following the Taylor expansion principle. Furthermore, we enhance model compactness with hash encoding based on different sparsities of the grids to prevent detrimental hash collisions, and a high-order extrapolation decoder to reduce explicit grid storage requirements. experimental results on both 2D and 3D reconstructions demonstrate the superior fitting and rendering accuracy of the proposed method across diverse signal types, validating its robustness and generalizability.

To address this limitation, we curate a dedicated instruction fine-tuning dataset that focuses on enhancing temporal comprehension across five key dimensions. In order to reduce reliance on costly temporal annotations, we introduce a multi-task prompt fine-tuning approach that seamlessly integrates temporal-sensitive tasks into existing instruction datasets without requiring additional annotations. Furthermore, we develop a novel benchmark for temporal-sensitive video understanding that not only fills the gaps in dimension coverage left by existing benchmarks but also rigorously filters out potential shortcuts, ensuring a more accurate evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the temporal understanding of video-LLMs while avoiding reliance on shortcuts.

Inverse rendering is inherently ill-posed, making it difficult to predict a single accurate solution. To address this challenge, recent generative model-based methods aim to present a range of possible solutions. However, finding a single accurate solution and generating diverse solutions can be conflicting. In this paper, we propose a channel-wise noise scheduling approach that allows a single diffusion model architecture to achieve two conflicting objectives. The resulting two diffusion models, trained with different channel-wise noise schedules, can predict a single highly accurate solution and present multiple possible solutions. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our two models in terms of both diversity and accuracy, which translates to enhanced performance in downstream applications such as object insertion and material editing.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09974	Uncertainty-aware Long-tailed Weights Model the Utility of Pseudo-labels for Semi-supervised Learning	Jiaqi Wu, Junbiao Pang, Qingming Huang	Current Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) adopts the pseudo-labeling strategy and further filters pseudo-labels based on confidence thresholds. However, this mechanism has notable drawbacks: 1) setting the reasonable threshold is an open problem which significantly influences the selection of the high-quality pseudo-labels; and 2) deep models often exhibit the over-confidence phenomenon which makes the confidence value an unreliable indicator for assessing the quality of pseudo-labels due to the scarcity of labeled data. In this paper, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Ensemble Structure (UES) to assess the utility of pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples. We further model the utility of pseudo-labels as long-tailed weights to avoid the open problem of setting the threshold. Concretely, the advantage of the long-tailed weights ensures that even unreliable pseudo-labels still contribute to enhancing the model's robustness. Besides, UES is lightweight and architecture-agnostic, easily extending to various computer vision tasks, including classification and regression. Experimental results demonstrate that combining the proposed method with DualPose leads to a 3.47% improvement in Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) on the Sniffing dataset with 100 data points (30 labeled), a 7.29\% improvement in PCK on the FLIC dataset with 100 data points (50 labeled), and a 3.91% improvement in PCK on the LSP dataset with 200 data points (100 labeled). Furthermore, when combined with FixMatch, the proposed method achieves a 0.2% accuracy improvement on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 40 labeled data points and a 0.26% accuracy improvement on the CIFAR-100 dataset with 400 labeled data points.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09968	Style Evolving along Chain-of-Thought for Unknown-Domain Object Detection	Zihao Zhang, Aming Wu, Yahong Han	Recently, a task of Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD) is proposed, aiming to generalize a detector to multiple unknown domains never seen before during training. Due to the unavailability of target-domain data, some methods leverage the multimodal capabilities of vision-language models, using textual prompts to estimate cross-domain information, enhancing the model's generalization capability. These methods typically use a single textual prompt, often referred to as the one-step prompt method. However, when dealing with complex styles such as the combination of rain and night, we observe that the performance of the one-step prompt method tends to be relatively weak. The reason may be that many scenes incorporate not just a single style but a combination of multiple styles. The one-step prompt method may not effectively synthesize combined information involving various styles. To address this limitation, we propose a new method, i.e., Style Evolving along Chain-of-Thought, which aims to progressively integrate and expand style information along the chain of thought, enabling the continual evolution of styles. Specifically, by progressively refining style descriptions and guiding the diverse evolution of styles, this approach enables more accurate simulation of various style characteristics and helps the model gradually learn and adapt to subtle differences between styles. Additionally, it exposes the model to a broader range of style features with different data distributions, thereby enhancing its generalization capability in unseen domains. The significant performance gains over five adverse-weather scenarios and the Real to Art benchmark demonstrate the superiorities of our method.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

One main challenge for this task is the high cost in manually annotating large-scale databases, which affects the generalization ability of ReID models. Recent works handle this problem by leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to describe pedestrian images automatically. However, the captions produced by MLLMs lack diversity in description styles. To address this issue, we propose a Human Annotator Modeling (HAM) approach to enable MLLMs to mimic the description styles of thousands of human annotators. Specifically, we first extract style features from human textual descriptions and perform clustering on them. This allows us to group textual descriptions with similar styles into the same cluster. Then, we employ a prompt to represent each of these clusters and apply prompt learning to mimic the description styles of different human annotators. Furthermore, we define a style feature space and perform uniform sampling in this space to obtain more diverse clustering prototypes, which further enriches the diversity of the MLLM-generated captions. Finally, we adopt HAM to automatically annotate a massive-scale database for text-to-image ReID. Extensive experiments on this database demonstrate that it significantly improves the generalization ability of ReID models.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]

However, existing algorithms usually only generate single-stage fusion features for state decision, which ignore that diverse kinds of features are required for identifying and locating the object, limiting the robustness and precision of tracking. In this paper, we propose a novel target-aware Bidirectional Fusion transformer (BFTrans) for UAV tracking. Specifically, we first present a two-stream fusion network based on linear self and cross attentions, which can combine the shallow and the deep features from both forward and backward directions, providing the adjusted local details for location and global semantics for recognition. Besides, a target-aware positional encoding strategy is designed for the above fusion model, which is helpful to perceive the object-related attributes during the fusion phase. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on several popular UAV benchmarks, including UAV-123, UAV20L and UAVTrack112. Massive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can exceed other state-of-the-art trackers and run with an average speed of 30.5 FPS on embedded platform, which is appropriate for practical drone deployments.

We propose a novel motion prediction conditional flow matching model, termed MoFlow, to predict K-shot future trajectories for all agents in a given scene. We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the $K$ sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all $K$ sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance. These models can generate diverse trajectories that are physically and socially plausible.

These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 16 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.

To address these challenges, we propose Cosh-DiT, a Co-speech gesture video system with hybrid Diffusion Transformers that perform audio-to-motion and motion-to-video synthesis using discrete and continuous diffusion modeling, respectively. First, we introduce an audio Diffusion Transformer (Cosh-DiT-A) to synthesize expressive gesture dynamics synchronized with speech rhythms. To capture upper body, facial, and hand movement priors, we employ vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) to jointly learn their dependencies within a discrete latent space. Then, for realistic video synthesis conditioned on the generated speech-driven motion, we design a visual Diffusion Transformer (Cosh-DiT-V) that effectively integrates spatial and temporal contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently generates lifelike videos with expressive facial expressions and natural, smooth gestures that align seamlessly with speech.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09941	TGP: Two-modal occupancy prediction with 3D Gaussian and sparse points for 3D Environment Awareness	Mu Chen, Wenyu Chen, Mingchuan Yang, Yuan Zhang, Tao Han, Xinchi Li, Yunlong Li, Huaici Zhao	3D semantic occupancy has rapidly become a research focus in the fields of robotics and autonomous driving environment perception due to its ability to provide more realistic geometric perception and its closer integration with downstream tasks. By performing occupancy prediction of the 3D space in the environment, the ability and robustness of scene understanding can be effectively improved. However, existing occupancy prediction tasks are primarily modeled using voxel or point cloud-based approaches: voxel-based network structures often suffer from the loss of spatial information due to the voxelization process, while point cloud-based methods, although better at retaining spatial location information, face limitations in representing volumetric structural details. To address this issue, we propose a dual-modal prediction method based on 3D Gaussian sets and sparse points, which balances both spatial location and volumetric structural information, achieving higher accuracy in semantic occupancy prediction. Specifically, our method adopts a Transformer-based architecture, taking 3D Gaussian sets, sparse points, and queries as inputs. Through the multi-layer structure of the Transformer, the enhanced queries and 3D Gaussian sets jointly contribute to the semantic occupancy prediction, and an adaptive fusion mechanism integrates the semantic outputs of both modalities to generate the final prediction results. Additionally, to further improve accuracy, we dynamically refine the point cloud at each layer, allowing for more precise location information during occupancy prediction. We conducted experiments on the Occ3DnuScenes dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method on IoU based metrics.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09938	PanoGen++: Domain-Adapted Text-Guided Panoramic Environment Generation for Vision-and-Language Navigation	Sen Wang, Dongliang Zhou, Liang Xie, Chao Xu, Ye Yan, Erwei Yin	Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) tasks require agents to navigate three-dimensional environments guided by natural language instructions, offering substantial potential for diverse applications. However, the scarcity of training data impedes progress in this field. This paper introduces PanoGen++, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by generating varied and pertinent panoramic environments for VLN tasks. PanoGen++ incorporates pre-trained diffusion models with domain-specific fine-tuning, employing parameter-efficient techniques such as low-rank adaptation to minimize computational costs. We investigate two settings for environment generation: masked image inpainting and recursive image outpainting. The former maximizes novel environment creation by inpainting masked regions based on textual descriptions, while the latter facilitates agents' learning of spatial relationships within panoramas. Empirical evaluations on room-to-room (R2R), room-for-room (R4R), and cooperative vision-and-dialog navigation (CVDN) datasets reveal significant performance enhancements: a 2.44% increase in success rate on the R2R test leaderboard, a 0.63% improvement on the R4R validation unseen set, and a 0.75-meter enhancement in goal progress on the CVDN validation unseen set. PanoGen++ augments the diversity and relevance of training environments, resulting in improved generalization and efficacy in VLN tasks.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 13 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.09929	Emotion Recognition with CLIP and Sequential Learning	Weiwei Zhou, Chenkun Ling, Zefeng Cai	"Human emotion recognition plays a crucial role in facilitating seamless interactions between humans and computers. In this paper, we present our innovative methodology for tackling the Valence-Arousal (VA) Estimation Challenge, the Expression Recognition Challenge, and the Action Unit (AU) Detection Challenge, all within the framework of the 8th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW).
Our approach introduces a novel framework aimed at enhancing continuous emotion recognition. This is achieved by fine-tuning the CLIP model with the aff-wild2 dataset, which provides annotated expression labels. The result is a fine-tuned model that serves as an efficient visual feature extractor, significantly improving its robustness. To further boost the performance of continuous emotion recognition, we incorporate Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) modules alongside Transformer Encoder modules into our system architecture. The integration of these advanced components allows our model to outperform baseline performance, demonstrating its ability to recognize human emotions with greater accuracy and efficiency."

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09926	VideoMerge: Towards Training-free Long Video Generation	Siyang Zhang, Harry Yang, Ser-Nam Lim	Long video generation remains a challenging and compelling topic in computer vision. Diffusion based models, among the various approaches to video generation, have achieved state of the art quality with their iterative denoising procedures. However, the intrinsic complexity of the video domain renders the training of such diffusion models exceedingly expensive in terms of both data curation and computational resources. Moreover, these models typically operate on a fixed noise tensor that represents the video, resulting in predetermined spatial and temporal dimensions. Although several high quality open-source pretrained video diffusion models, jointly trained on images and videos of varying lengths and resolutions, are available, it is generally not recommended to specify a video length at inference that was not included in the training set. Consequently, these models are not readily adaptable to the direct generation of longer videos by merely increasing the specified video length. In addition to feasibility challenges, long-video generation also encounters quality issues. The domain of long videos is inherently more complex than that of short videos: extended durations introduce greater variability and necessitate long-range temporal consistency, thereby increasing the overall difficulty of the task. We propose VideoMerge, a training-free method that can be seamlessly adapted to merge short videos generated by pretrained text-to-video diffusion model. Our approach preserves the model's original expressiveness and consistency while allowing for extended duration and dynamic variation as specified by the user. By leveraging the strengths of pretrained models, our method addresses challenges related to smoothness, consistency, and dynamic content through orthogonal strategies that operate collaboratively to achieve superior quality.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09878	CleverDistiller: Simple and Spatially Consistent Cross-modal Distillation	Hariprasath Govindarajan, Maciej K. Wozniak, Marvin Klingner, Camille Maurice, B Ravi Kiran, Senthil Yogamani	Vision foundation models (VFMs) such as DINO have led to a paradigm shift in 2D camera-based perception towards extracting generalized features to support many downstream tasks. Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 12 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.09873	FDCT: Frequency-Aware Decomposition and Cross-Modal Token-Alignment for Multi-Sensor Target Classification	Shoaib Meraj Sami, Md Mahedi Hasan, Nasser M. Nasrabadi, Raghuveer Rao	In automatic target recognition (ATR) systems, sensors may fail to capture discriminative, fine-grained detail features due to environmental conditions, noise created by CMOS chips, occlusion, parallaxes, and sensor misalignment. Therefore, multi-sensor image fusion is an effective choice to overcome these constraints. However, multi-modal image sensors are heterogeneous and have domain and granularity gaps. In addition, the multi-sensor images can be misaligned due to intricate background clutters, fluctuating illumination conditions, and uncontrolled sensor settings. In this paper, to overcome these issues, we decompose, align, and fuse multiple image sensor data for target classification. We extract the domain-specific and domain-invariant features from each sensor data. We propose to develop a shared unified discrete token (UDT) space between sensors to reduce the domain and granularity gaps. Additionally, we develop an alignment module to overcome the misalignment between multi-sensors and emphasize the discriminative representation of the UDT space. In the alignment module, we introduce sparsity constraints to provide a better cross-modal representation of the UDT space and robustness against various sensor settings. We achieve superior classification performance compared to single-modality classifiers and several state-of-the-art multi-modal fusion algorithms on four multi-sensor ATR datasets.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09871	LuciBot: Automated Robot Policy Learning from Generated Videos	Xiaowen Qiu, Yian Wang, Jiting Cai, Zhehuan Chen, Chunru Lin, Tsun-Hsuan Wang, Chuang Gan	Automatically generating training supervision for embodied tasks is crucial, as manual designing is tedious and not scalable. While prior works use large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rewards, these approaches are largely limited to simple tasks with well-defined rewards, such as pick-and-place. This limitation arises because LLMs struggle to interpret complex scenes compressed into text or code due to their restricted input modality, while VLM-based rewards, though better at visual perception, remain limited by their less expressive output modality. To address these challenges, we leverage the imagination capability of general-purpose video generation models. Given an initial simulation frame and a textual task description, the video generation model produces a video demonstrating task completion with correct semantics. We then extract rich supervisory signals from the generated video, including 6D object pose sequences, 2D segmentations, and estimated depth, to facilitate task learning in simulation. Our approach significantly improves supervision quality for complex embodied tasks, enabling large-scale training in simulators.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 12 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.09867	Object-Aware DINO (Oh-A-Dino): Enhancing Self-Supervised Representations for Multi-Object Instance Retrieval	Stefan Sylvius Wagner, Stefan Harmeling	Object-centric learning is fundamental to human vision and crucial for models requiring complex reasoning. Traditional approaches rely on slot-based bottlenecks to learn object properties explicitly, while recent self-supervised vision models like DINO have shown emergent object understanding. However, DINO representations primarily capture global scene features, often confounding individual object attributes. We investigate the effectiveness of DINO representations and slot-based methods for multi-object instance retrieval. Our findings reveal that DINO representations excel at capturing global object attributes such as object shape and size, but struggle with object-level details like colour, whereas slot-based representations struggle at both global and object-level understanding. To address this, we propose a method that combines global and local features by augmenting DINO representations with object-centric latent vectors from a Variational Autoencoder trained on segmented image patches that are extracted from the DINO features. This approach improves multi-object instance retrieval performance, bridging the gap between global scene understanding and fine-grained object representation without requiring full model retraining.

The advancement of deep learning has facilitated the creation of numerous medical datasets with diverse expert-level annotations. Aggregating these datasets can maximize data utilization and address the inadequacy of labeled data. However, the heterogeneity of expert-level annotations across tasks such as classification, localization, and segmentation presents a significant challenge for learning from these datasets. To this end, we introduce nFoundation X, an end-to-end framework that utilizes diverse expert-level annotations from numerous public datasets to train a foundation model capable of multiple tasks including classification, localization, and segmentation. To address the challenges of annotation and task heterogeneity, we propose a Lock-Release pretraining strategy to enhance the cyclic learning from multiple datasets, combined with the student-teacher learning paradigm, ensuring the model retains general knowledge for all tasks while preventing overfitting to any single task. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Foundation X, we trained a model using 11 chest X-ray datasets, covering annotations for classification, localization, and segmentation tasks. Our experimental results show that Foundation X achieves notable performance gains through extensive annotation utilization, excels in cross-dataset and cross-task learning, and further enhances performance in organ localization and segmentation tasks.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09837	On the Limitations of Vision-Language Models in Understanding Image Transforms	Ahmad Mustafa Anis, Hasnain Ali, Saquib Sarfraz	Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in various downstream tasks, including Image/Video Generation, Visual Question Answering, Multimodal Chatbots, and Video Understanding. However, these models often struggle with basic image transformations. This paper investigates the image-level understanding of VLMs, specifically CLIP by OpenAI and SigLIP by Google. Our findings reveal that these models lack comprehension of multiple image-level augmentations. To facilitate this study, we created an augmented version of the Flickr8k dataset, pairing each image with a detailed description of the applied transformation. We further explore how this deficiency impacts downstream tasks, particularly in image editing, and evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art Image2Image models on simple transformations.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09830	Exploring Position Encoding in Diffusion U-Net for Training-free High-resolution Image Generation	Feng Zhou, Pu Cao, Yiyang Ma, Lu Yang, Jianqin Yin	Denoising higher-resolution latents via a pre-trained U-Net leads to repetitive and disordered image patterns. Although recent studies make efforts to improve generative quality by aligning denoising process across original and higher resolutions, the root cause of suboptimal generation is still lacking exploration. Through comprehensive analysis of position encoding in U-Net, we attribute it to inconsistent position encoding, sourced by the inadequate propagation of position information from zero-padding to latent features in convolution layers as resolution increases. To address this issue, we propose a novel training-free approach, introducing a Progressive Boundary Complement (PBC) method. This method creates dynamic virtual image boundaries inside the feature map to enhance position information propagation, enabling high-quality and rich-content high-resolution image synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 12 Mar 2025]
10.48550/arXiv.2503.09828	Resolution Invariant Autoencoder	Ashay Patel, Michela Antonelli, Sebastien Ourselin, M. Jorge Cardoso	Deep learning has significantly advanced medical imaging analysis, yet variations in image resolution remain an overlooked challenge. Most methods address this by resampling images, leading to either information loss or computational inefficiencies. While solutions exist for specific tasks, no unified approach has been proposed. We introduce a resolution-invariant autoencoder that adapts spatial resizing at each layer in the network via a learned variable resizing process, replacing fixed spatial down/upsampling at the traditional factor of 2. This ensures a consistent latent space resolution, regardless of input or output resolution. Our model enables various downstream tasks to be performed on an image latent whilst maintaining performance across different resolutions, overcoming the shortfalls of traditional methods. We demonstrate its effectiveness in uncertainty-aware super-resolution, classification, and generative modelling tasks and show how our method outperforms conventional baselines with minimal performance loss across resolutions.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09826	Isolated Channel Vision Transformers: From Single-Channel Pretraining to Multi-Channel Finetuning	Wenyi Lian, Joakim Lindblad, Patrick Micke, Nataša Sladoje	Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in standard RGB image processing tasks. However, applying ViTs to multi-channel imaging (MCI) data, e.g., for medical and remote sensing applications, remains a challenge. In particular, MCI data often consist of layers acquired from different modalities. Directly training ViTs on such data can obscure complementary information and impair the performance. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective pretraining framework for large-scale MCI datasets. Our method, named Isolated Channel ViT (IC-ViT), patchifies image channels individually and thereby enables pretraining for multimodal multi-channel tasks. We show that this channel-wise patchifying is a key technique for MCI processing. More importantly, one can pretrain the IC-ViT on single channels and finetune it on downstream multi-channel datasets. This pretraining framework captures dependencies between patches as well as channels and produces robust feature representation. Experiments on various tasks and benchmarks, including JUMP-CP and CHAMMI for cell microscopy imaging, and So2Sat-LCZ42 for satellite imaging, show that the proposed IC-ViT delivers 4-14 percentage points of performance improvement over existing channel-adaptive approaches. Further, its efficient training makes it a suitable candidate for large-scale pretraining of foundation models on heterogeneous data.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 12 Mar 2025]

Sabuncu, Johannes C. Paetzold	Accurate staging of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is essential for guiding timely interventions and preventing vision loss. However, current staging models are hardly interpretable, and most public datasets contain no clinical reasoning or interpretation beyond image-level labels. In this paper, we present a novel method that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language models (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing biologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as vessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then performs DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and edges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We collect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to physiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into textual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual descriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final agent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human interpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental evaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically interpretable results. An expert study further demonstrates that our method provides more accurate diagnostic explanations and paves the way for precise localization of pathologies in OCTA images.

An experimental study	Qingwu Liu, Nicolas Saunier, Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau	Image-based multi-object detection (MOD) and multi-object tracking (MOT) are advancing at a fast pace. A variety of 2D and 3D MOD and MOT methods have been developed for monocular and stereo cameras. Road safety analysis can benefit from those advancements. As crashes are rare events, surrogate measures of safety (SMoS) have been developed for safety analyses. (Semi-)Automated safety analysis methods extract road user trajectories to compute safety indicators, for example, Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Post-encroachment Time (PET). Inspired by the success of deep learning in MOD and MOT, we investigate three MOT methods, including one based on a stereo-camera, using the annotated KITTI traffic video dataset. Two post-processing steps, IDsplit and SS, are developed to improve the tracking results and investigate the factors influencing the TTC. The experimental results show that, despite some advantages in terms of the numbers of interactions or similarity to the TTC distributions, all the tested methods systematically over-estimate the number of interactions and under-estimate the TTC: they report more interactions and more severe interactions, making the road user interactions appear less safe than they are. Further efforts will be directed towards testing more methods and more data, in particular from roadside sensors, to verify the results and improve the performance.

Synthetic data has emerged as a viable solution to augment real-world datasets due to its cost-effectiveness, availability of precise ground-truth labels, and the ability to model specific edge cases. However, synthetic data may introduce distributional differences and biases that could impact model performance in real-world settings. To evaluate the utility and limitations of synthetic data, we conducted controlled experiments using multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset generated by BIT Technology Solutions GmbH. Our study spans two sensor modalities, camera and LiDAR, and investigates both 2D and 3D object detection tasks. We compare models trained on real, synthetic, and mixed datasets, analyzing their robustness and generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that the use of a combination of real and synthetic data improves the robustness and generalization of object detection models, underscoring the potential of synthetic data in advancing autonomous driving technologies.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09797	SeqSAM: Autoregressive Multiple Hypothesis Prediction for Medical Image Segmentation using SAM	Benjamin Towle, Xin Chen, Ke Zhou	Pre-trained segmentation models are a powerful and flexible tool for segmenting images. Recently, this trend has extended to medical imaging. Yet, often these methods only produce a single prediction for a given image, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical images, due to unclear object boundaries and errors caused by the annotation tool. Multiple Choice Learning is a technique for generating multiple masks, through multiple learned prediction heads. However, this cannot readily be extended to producing more outputs than its initial pre-training hyperparameters, as the sparse, winner-takes-all loss function makes it easy for one prediction head to become overly dominant, thus not guaranteeing the clinical relevancy of each mask produced. We introduce SeqSAM, a sequential, RNN-inspired approach to generating multiple masks, which uses a bipartite matching loss for ensuring the clinical relevancy of each mask, and can produce an arbitrary number of masks. We show notable improvements in quality of each mask produced across two publicly available datasets. Our code is available at this https URL.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 12 Mar 2025]

Balasubramanian, Leonid Sigal, Matthew A. Turk	The biases exhibited by Text-to-Image (TTI) models are often treated as if they are independent, but in reality, they may be deeply interrelated. Addressing bias along one dimension, such as ethnicity or age, can inadvertently influence another dimension, like gender, either mitigating or exacerbating existing disparities. Understanding these interdependencies is crucial for designing fairer generative models, yet measuring such effects quantitatively remains a challenge. In this paper, we aim to address these questions by introducing BiasConnect, a novel tool designed to analyze and quantify bias interactions in TTI models. Our approach leverages a counterfactual-based framework to generate pairwise causal graphs that reveals the underlying structure of bias interactions for the given text prompt. Additionally, our method provides empirical estimates that indicate how other bias dimensions shift toward or away from an ideal distribution when a given bias is modified. Our estimates have a strong correlation (+0.69) with the interdependency observations post bias mitigation. We demonstrate the utility of BiasConnect for selecting optimal bias mitigation axes, comparing different TTI models on the dependencies they learn, and understanding the amplification of intersectional societal biases in TTI models.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09754	A PyTorch-Enabled Tool for Synthetic Event Camera Data Generation and Algorithm Development	Joseph L. Greene, Adrish Kar, Ignacio Galindo, Elijah Quiles, Elliott Chen, Matthew Anderson	Event, or neuromorphic cameras, offer a novel encoding of natural scenes by asynchronously reporting significant changes in brightness, known as events, with improved dynamic range, temporal resolution and lower data bandwidth when compared to conventional cameras. However, their adoption in domain-specific research tasks is hindered in part by limited commercial availability, lack of existing datasets, and challenges related to predicting the impact of their nonlinear optical encoding, unique noise model and tensor-based data processing requirements. To address these challenges, we introduce Synthetic Events for Neural Processing and Integration (SENPI) in Python, a PyTorch-based library for simulating and processing event camera data. SENPI includes a differentiable digital twin that converts intensity-based data into event representations, allowing for evaluation of event camera performance while handling the non-smooth and nonlinear nature of the forward model The library also supports modules for event-based I/O, manipulation, filtering and visualization, creating efficient and scalable workflows for both synthetic and real event-based data. We demonstrate SENPI's ability to produce realistic event-based data by comparing synthetic outputs to real event camera data and use these results to draw conclusions on the properties and utility of event-based perception. Additionally, we showcase SENPI's use in exploring event camera behavior under varying noise conditions and optimizing event contrast threshold for improved encoding under target conditions. Ultimately, SENPI aims to lower the barrier to entry for researchers by providing an accessible tool for event data generation and algorithmic developmnent, making it a valuable resource for advancing research in neuromorphic vision systems.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09750	SASNet: Spatially-Adaptive Sinusoidal Neural Networks	Haoan Feng, Diana Aldana, Tiago Novello, Leila De Floriani	Sinusoidal neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as powerful implicit neural representations (INRs) for low-dimensional signals in computer vision and graphics. They enable high-frequency signal reconstruction and smooth manifold modeling; however, they often suffer from spectral bias, training instability, and overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose SASNet, Spatially-Adaptive SNNs that robustly enhance the capacity of compact INRs to fit detailed signals. SASNet integrates a frequency embedding layer to control frequency components and mitigate spectral bias, along with jointly optimized, spatially-adaptive masks that localize neuron influence, reducing network redundancy and improving convergence stability. Robust to hyperparameter selection, SASNet faithfully reconstructs high-frequency signals without overfitting low-frequency regions. Our experiments show that SASNet outperforms state-of-the-art INRs, achieving strong fitting accuracy, super-resolution capability, and noise suppression, without sacrificing model compactness.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09749	A Siamese Network to Detect If Two Iris Images Are Monozygotic	Yongle Yuan, Kevin W. Bowyer	In Daugman-style iris recognition, the textures of the left and right irises of the same person are traditionally considered as being as different as the irises of two unrelated persons. However, previous research indicates that humans can detect that two iris images are from different eyes of the same person, or eyes of monozygotic twins, with an accuracy of about 80%. In this work, we employ a Siamese network architecture and contrastive learning to categorize a pair of iris images as coming from monozygotic or non-monozygotic irises. This could potentially be applied, for example, as a fast, noninvasive test to determine if twins are monozygotic or non-monozygotic. We construct a dataset comprising both synthetic monozygotic pairs (images of different irises of the same individual) and natural monozygotic pairs (images of different images from persons who are identical twins), in addition to non-monozygotic pairs from unrelated individuals, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the model's capabilities. To gain deeper insights into the learned representations, we train and analyze three variants of the model using (1) the original input images, (2) iris-only images, and (3) non-iris-only images. This comparison reveals the critical importance of iris-specific textural details and contextual ocular cues in identifying monozygotic iris patterns. The results demonstrate that models leveraging full eye-region information outperform those trained solely on iris-only data, emphasizing the nuanced interplay between iris and ocular characteristics. Our approach achieves accuracy levels using the full iris image that exceed those previously reported for human classification of monozygotic iris pairs. This study presents the first classifier designed to determine whether a pair of iris images originates from monozygotic individuals.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 12 Mar 2025]

Our approach combines the precision of a computer graphics pipeline, enabling accurate control over elements such as camera movement, object rotation, and character animation, with the visual fidelity of generative AI to produce high-quality videos from coarsely rendered inputs. To support animations with any initial start point and extended sequences, we adopt a two-stage generation process guided by 3D geometry: 1) 3D-Guided Keyframe Generation, where a customized image diffusion model refines rendered keyframes to ensure consistency and quality, and 2) 3D-Guided Video Interpolation, a training-free approach that generates smooth, high-quality video frames between keyframes using bidirectional guidance.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.09675	Accelerating Diffusion Sampling via Exploiting Local Transition Coherence	Shangwen Zhu, Han Zhang, Zhantao Yang, Qianyu Peng, Zhao Pu, Huangji Wang, Fan Cheng	Text-based diffusion models have made significant breakthroughs in generating high-quality images and videos from textual descriptions. However, the lengthy sampling time of the denoising process remains a significant bottleneck in practical applications. Previous methods either ignore the statistical relationships between adjacent steps or rely on attention or feature similarity between them, which often only works with specific network structures. To address this issue, we discover a new statistical relationship in the transition operator between adjacent steps, focusing on the relationship of the outputs from the network. This relationship does not impose any requirements on the network structure. Based on this observation, we propose a novel training-free acceleration method called LTC-Accel, which uses the identified relationship to estimate the current transition operator based on adjacent steps. Due to no specific assumptions regarding the network structure, LTC-Accel is applicable to almost all diffusion-based methods and orthogonal to almost all existing acceleration techniques, making it easy to combine with them. Experimental results demonstrate that LTC-Accel significantly speeds up sampling in text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis while maintaining competitive sample quality. Specifically, LTC-Accel achieves a speedup of 1.67-fold in Stable Diffusion v2 and a speedup of 1.55-fold in video generation models. When combined with distillation models, LTC-Accel achieves a remarkable 10-fold speedup in video generation, allowing real-time generation of more than 16FPS.

However, their reliance on publicly available data and the growing trend of data sharing for fine-tuning make these models particularly vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce the Silent Branding Attack, a novel data poisoning method that manipulates text-to-image diffusion models to generate images containing specific brand logos or symbols without any text triggers. We find that when certain visual patterns are repeatedly in the training data, the model learns to reproduce them naturally in its outputs, even without prompt mentions. Leveraging this, we develop an automated data poisoning algorithm that unobtrusively injects logos into original images, ensuring they blend naturally and remain undetected. Models trained on this poisoned dataset generate images containing logos without degrading image quality or text alignment. We experimentally validate our silent branding attack across two realistic settings on large-scale high-quality image datasets and style personalization datasets, achieving high success rates even without a specific text trigger. Human evaluation and quantitative metrics including logo detection show that our method can stealthily embed logos.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	[ 12 Mar 2025]

Previous studies have typically focused on either enhancing the visual quality of synthesized images at the expense of sampling efficiency or dramatically accelerating sampling without improving the base model's generative capacity. Moreover, nearly all inference methods have not been able to ensure stable performance simultaneously on both diffusion models (DMs) and visual autoregressive models (ARMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel plug-and-play inference paradigm, CoRe^2, which comprises three subprocesses: Collect, Reflect, and Refine. CoRe^2 first collects classifier-free guidance (CFG) trajectories, and then use collected data to train a weak model that reflects the easy-to-learn contents while reducing number of function evaluations during inference by half. Subsequently, CoRe^2 employs weak-to-strong guidance to refine the conditional output, thereby improving the model's capacity to generate high-frequency and realistic content, which is difficult for the base model to capture. To the best of our knowledge, CoRe^2 is the first to demonstrate both efficiency and effectiveness across a wide range of DMs, including SDXL, SD3.5, and FLUX, as well as ARMs like LlamaGen. It has exhibited significant performance improvements on HPD v2, Pick-of-Pic, Drawbench, GenEval, and T2I-Compbench. Furthermore, CoRe^2 can be seamlessly integrated with the state-of-the-art Z-Sampling, outperforming it by 0.3 and 0.16 on PickScore and AES, while achieving 5.64s time saving using this http URL is released at this https URL.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10637	Distilling Diversity and Control in Diffusion Models	Rohit Gandikota, David Bau	Distilled diffusion models suffer from a critical limitation: reduced sample diversity compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we uncover that despite this diversity loss, distilled models retain the fundamental concept representations of base models. We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we introduce Diffusion Target (DT) Visualization, an analysis and debugging tool that reveals how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through DT-Visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - a hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification not only restores the diversity capabilities from base to distilled models but surprisingly exceeds it, while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference, all without requiring additional training or model modifications.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10636	The Curse of Conditions: Analyzing and Improving Optimal Transport for Conditional Flow-Based Generation	Ho Kei Cheng, Alexander Schwing	Minibatch optimal transport coupling straightens paths in unconditional flow matching. This leads to computationally less demanding inference as fewer integration steps and less complex numerical solvers can be employed when numerically solving an ordinary differential equation at test time. However, in the conditional setting, minibatch optimal transport falls short. This is because the default optimal transport mapping disregards conditions, resulting in a conditionally skewed prior distribution during training. In contrast, at test time, we have no access to the skewed prior, and instead sample from the full, unbiased prior distribution. This gap between training and testing leads to a subpar performance. To bridge this gap, we propose conditional optimal transport C^2OT that adds a conditional weighting term in the cost matrix when computing the optimal transport assignment. Experiments demonstrate that this simple fix works with both discrete and continuous conditions in 8gaussians-to-moons, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32x32, and ImageNet-256x256. Our method performs better overall compared to the existing baselines across different function evaluation budgets.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10633	Charting and Navigating Hugging Face's Model Atlas	Eliahu Horwitz, Nitzan Kurer, Jonathan Kahana, Liel Amar, Yedid Hoshen	As there are now millions of publicly available neural networks, searching and analyzing large model repositories becomes increasingly important. Navigating so many models requires an atlas, but as most models are poorly documented charting such an atlas is challenging. To explore the hidden potential of model repositories, we chart a preliminary atlas representing the documented fraction of Hugging Face. It provides stunning visualizations of the model landscape and evolution. We demonstrate several applications of this atlas including predicting model attributes (e.g., accuracy), and analyzing trends in computer vision models. However, as the current atlas remains incomplete, we propose a method for charting undocumented regions. Specifically, we identify high-confidence structural priors based on dominant real-world model training practices. Leveraging these priors, our approach enables accurate mapping of previously undocumented areas of the atlas. We publicly release our datasets, code, and interactive atlas.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.10632	Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention: Is Learnable Attention Better For Vision Transformers?	Subhajit Maity, Killian Hitsman, Xin Li, Aritra Dutta	Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are a remarkable innovation consisting of learnable activation functions with the potential to capture more complex relationships from data. Although KANs are useful in finding symbolic representations and continual learning of one-dimensional functions, their effectiveness in diverse machine learning (ML) tasks, such as vision, remains questionable. Presently, KANs are deployed by replacing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in deep network architectures, including advanced architectures such as vision Transformers (ViTs). In this paper, we are the first to design a general learnable Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt) for vanilla ViTs that can operate on any choice of basis. However, the computing and memory costs of training them motivated us to propose a more modular version, and we designed particular learnable attention, called Fourier-KArAt. Fourier-KArAt and its variants either outperform their ViT counterparts or show comparable performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets. We dissect these architectures' performance and generalization capacity by analyzing their loss landscapes, weight distributions, optimizer path, attention visualization, and spectral behavior, and contrast them with vanilla ViTs. The goal of this paper is not to produce parameter- and compute-efficient attention, but to encourage the community to explore KANs in conjunction with more advanced architectures that require a careful understanding of learnable activations.
