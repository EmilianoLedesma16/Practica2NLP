In this study, 79 patients with WMH from hospital 1 were randomly divided into a training set (62 patients) and an internal validation set (17 patients). In addition, 29 WMH patients from hospital 2 were used as an external validation set. Cognitive status was determined based on neuropsychological assessment results. A deep learning convolutional neural network of VB-Nets was used to automatically identify and segment whole-brain subregions and WMH. The PyRadiomics package in Python was used to automatically extract radiomic features from the WMH and bilateral hippocampi. Delong tests revealed that the random forest model based on combined features had the best performance for the detection of cognitive impairment in WMH patients, with an AUC of 0.900 in the external validation set. Our results provide clinical doctors with a reliable tool for the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment in WMH patients.	2025 Jan-Dec:40:15333175251325091.
https:/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//40087101/	Hand therapists' usage and perception of technology and telerehabilitation: An online survey study with a qualitative component	Caitlin Symonette, Claire A Parent ,, Jacob Davidson ,, Joey Pipicelli ,, Justin Kang, Justin Kang ,	Background: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a shift in healthcare delivery, necessitating the rapid adoption of technology, including telerehabilitation. This study focused on understanding the current perspectives and experiences of hand therapists in Canada and the United States regarding implementation of telerehabilitation in hand therapy, traditionally reliant on in-person interactions. Purpose: The study aimed to assess the utilization, perceptions, and barriers of telerehabilitation among hand therapists, providing insights into challenges and opportunities for incorporation into practices. Study design: A cross-sectional survey collected responses from hand therapists through electronic surveys distributed via the American Society of Hand Therapists (ASHT) and the Canadian Society of Hand Therapists (CSHT) mailing lists. Methods: The survey, approved by the Western University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board, included nine demographic questions, eight rating questions, and four open-ended questions, focusing on technology acceptance and telerehabilitation satisfaction. Participants met criteria as licensed therapists with expertise in hand rehabilitation, practicing in Canada or the United States. Results: A total of 129 participants completed the survey. Most therapists (84.3%) reported high comfort with basic technology, yet only 56.8% used technology in practice. Common modalities included internet (71.2%), telephone (61.8%), and smartphone applications (53.2%). Only 1.6% reported frequently using biometrics, and 0.0% for advanced technologies like wearables. While 75% recognized telerehabilitation's usefulness in improving patient accessibility, 91.5% believed it could not fully replace traditional methods. Concerns included poor quality in assessing orthoses fit (69.9%) and strength (53.3%). United States respondents were less likely to report current use of telerehabilitation (OR: 0.195; 95% CI [0.064-0.595]). Conclusions: The study addressed technology-related challenges and highlights hand therapists' perceptions towards integrating telerehabilitation. Barriers related to rural areas and diverse patient conditions emphasize the importance of tailored approaches. Future directions should explore emerging technologies like virtual reality and artificial intelligence for enhanced clinical effectiveness of telerehabilitation.	2025 Mar 13:S0894-1130(25)00004-3.

To address these challenges, this study introduces a collaborative pose tracking control strategy that integrates third-order active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) for a single actuator and multi-agent consensus control for multiple actuators. Solved the problem of reduced pose tracking accuracy caused by internal modeling uncertainty of actuators, external interference, and mutual interference between actuators. And the stability of this control approach is theoretically proven. Subsequently, the control strategy is implemented on a six-DOF parallel mechanism for comprehensive simulation and experimental. Simulation and experimental results show that compared with using an ADRC to regulate a single actuator, the proposed control strategy reduces position and attitude errors by about 90%, verifying the effectiveness of the control strategy proposed in this paper.	2025 Feb 28:S0019-0578(25)00105-3.

The phenomenon of selling porcini mushrooms as old mixed with new jeopardizes consumer safety. Herein, nucleoside contents and spectra of 831 Boletus bainiugan stored for 0, 1 and 2 years are comprehensively analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with Fourier transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy. Guanosine and adenosine increased with storage time, and uridine has a decreasing trend. Multi-conventional machine learning and deep learning models are employed to identify the storage time of Boletus bainiugan, in which convolutional neural network (CNN) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) models have superior identification performance for distinct storage periods. The Data-driven soft independent modelling of class analogy (DD-SIMCA) model can completely differentiate between new and old samples, and partial least squares regression (PLSR) can accurately predict the three nucleoside compounds with an optimal R2 of 0.918 and an excellent residual predictive deviation (RPD) value of 3.492. This study provides a low-cost and user-friendly solution for the market to determine, in real time, storage period of Boletus bainiugan in the supply chain.	2025 Aug:129:104743.
https:/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//40086958/	AGEs in cooked meat: Production, detection, and mechanisms of its inhibition by plant extracts	Daodong Pan, Jie Luo ,, Kaiyong Yao ,, Qingwu Shen ,, Xiankang Fan ,, Xiaoqun Zeng ,, Xue Han, Xue Han ,, Yangying Sun ,, Zhen Wu ,, Zihang Shi ,	With the growing demand for food safety and nutrition, the challenge of ensuring the quality of cooked meat products while reducing the accumulation of AGEs during processing needs urgent attention. In this study, the patterns of AGEs production, detection methods, quality contribution, and molecular mechanisms of its inhibition by natural plant-based extracts (NPBE) in cooked meat products were comprehensively reviewed. NPBE can effectively reduce the accumulation of AGEs in meat by binding to AGEs precursors and reducing glycosylation sites. It has also been shown to significantly remove off-flavour, and inhibit protein carbonylation. The potential for synergistic inhibition of AGE formation using NPBE and exogenous physical field treatments such as pulsed electric fields, microwave irradiation, thermal cycling of air, and ultrasound was emphasized, as well as the urgent need for the development of portable AGE detectors integrated with artificial intelligence and big data analytical models. This study indicates the future research direction for inhibiting the generation of AGEs in cooked meat products, which can promote and guide the practical application of NPBE in cooked meat products.	2025 Apr:207:116067.

The prolonged heating duration modified intensively on puree structure and rheology, and resulted significant increases of μs' at 900-1350 nm. Based on Monte Carlo simulation, the maximum light attenuation distance at 1050 nm of 'Golden Delicious' and 'Red Delicious' apple puree increased intensively from 16.22 mm to 17.60 mm and from 16.19 mm to 17.41 mm respectively while thermal processing duration from 10 min to 20 min. Back propagation neural network models based on μa and μs' can monitor their dry matter content, titratable acidity, apparent viscosity and viscoelasticity, with the RPD > 2.53. These provided fundamental knowledge on light propagation of puree matrix and the potential strategy to monitor their quality.	2025 Apr:207:115997.

We aimed to develop and conduct usability testing of Artificial Intelligence Assisted Prevention and Management for Delirium (AI-AntiDelirium), a CDSS designed to identify delirium and modifiable risk factors and prevent and manage delirium in the ICU. Methods: Between January and April 2021, a cross-sectional study including 117 ICU nurses recruited for usability testing from four ICUs in two university-affiliated hospitals was conducted. The development of AI-AntiDelirium included needs assessment, function design, iterative design, agile development, and usability testing using the Delirium System Usability Evaluation Scale (Delirium-SUES). Results: Based on the needs assessment, AI-AntiDelirium was developed to contain four main modules-delirium assessment tools, risk-factor assessment, nursing care plan, and care activity list-and was designed to provide individualized interventions based on patient risk factors. The mean Delirium-SUES score was 184.64 (full score: 210), indicating that AI-AntiDelirium was acceptable in terms of usefulness, ease of use, attitude, use tendency, and long-term effects. Conclusions: Our study developed AI-AntiDelirium, a CDSS perceived as useful and easy to use. Incorporating usability evaluation when designing AI-AntiDelirium may be effective in and enhancing clinical staff use.	2025 Apr:82:151921.
