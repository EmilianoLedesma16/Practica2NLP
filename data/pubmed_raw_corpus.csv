40087407	SIRT5 safeguards against primate skeletal muscle ageing via desuccinylation of TBK1	Feifei Liu , Guang-Hui Liu, Guoguang Zhao , Haijun Wang , Haoyan Huang , Jing Qu , Qian Zhao, Qian Zhao # , Shuai Ma , Shuhui Sun , Si Wang , Weiqi Zhang , Xiaobing Fu , Xiaoyu Jiang # , Xin Zhang # , Yang Yu , Ying Jing # , Zhihua Zhang ,	Ageing-induced skeletal muscle deterioration contributes to sarcopenia and frailty, adversely impacting the quality of life in the elderly. However, the molecular mechanisms behind primate skeletal muscle ageing remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that SIRT5 expression is reduced in aged primate skeletal muscles from both genders. SIRT5 deficiency in human myotubes hastens cellular senescence and intensifies inflammation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TBK1 is a natural substrate for SIRT5. SIRT5 desuccinylates TBK1 at lysine 137, which leads to TBK1 dephosphorylation and the suppression of the downstream inflammatory pathway. Using SIRT5 lentiviral vectors for skeletal muscle gene therapy in male mice enhances physical performance and alleviates age-related muscle dysfunction. This study sheds light on the molecular underpinnings of skeletal muscle ageing and presents the SIRT5-TBK1 pathway as a promising target for combating age-related skeletal muscle degeneration.	14/03/2025
40087396	Endothelial TDP-43 depletion disrupts core blood-brain barrier pathways in neurodegeneration	Amy L Kimble , Ashok Cheemala , Bing Hao , Bo Reese , Evan R Jellison , Jordan D Tyburski , Omar M F Omar, Omar M F Omar , Patrick A Murphy, Qian Wu , Riqiang Yan , Swati Pandey , Yunfeng Li ,	Endothelial cells (ECs) help maintain the blood-brain barrier but deteriorate in many neurodegenerative disorders. Here we show, using a specialized method to isolate EC and microglial nuclei from postmortem human cortex (92 donors, 50 male and 42 female, aged 20-98 years), that intranuclear cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes enables simultaneous profiling of nuclear proteins and RNA transcripts at a single-nucleus resolution. We identify a disease-associated subset of capillary ECs in Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration. These capillaries exhibit reduced nuclear β-catenin and β-catenin-downstream genes, along with elevated TNF/NF-κB markers. Notably, these transcriptional changes correlate with the loss of nuclear TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein also depleted in neuronal nuclei. TDP-43 disruption in human and mouse ECs replicates these alterations, suggesting that TDP-43 deficiency in ECs is an important factor contributing to blood-brain barrier breakdown in neurodegenerative diseases.	14/03/2025
40087408	Human gut microbial aromatic amino acid and related metabolites prevent obesity through intestinal immune control	Danyang Li , Diyin Li # , Jianhua Luo , Ju-Sheng Zheng , Laibao Zhuo # , Liang Tao, Lingjun Chen # , Liuqing He # , Rui-Qi Shi , Xiao Congmei , Yu-Ming Chen , Yuanqing Fu , Yuhui Feng , Yuhui Liang , Zengliang Jiang, Zengliang Jiang # ,	Obesity affects millions of people in the world. The gut microbiome influences body fat accumulation, but the mechanisms remain to be investigated. Here, we show an association between microbial aromatic amino acid metabolites in serum and body fat accumulation in a large Chinese longitudinal cohort. We next identify that 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4HPAA) and its analogues effectively protect male mice from high-fat-diet-induced obesity. These metabolites act on intestinal mucosa to regulate the immune response and control lipid uptake, which protects against obesity. We further demonstrate that T cells and B cells are not vital for 4HPAA-mediated obesity prevention, and innate lymphoid cells have antagonistic roles. Together, these findings reveal specific microbial metabolites as pivotal molecules to prohibit obesity through immune control, establishing mechanisms of host modulation by gut microbial metabolites.	14/03/2025

Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of inhaled sevoflurane compared with intravenous propofol for sedation in patients with ARDS. Design, setting, and participants: Phase 3 randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded clinical trial conducted from May 2020 to October 2023 with 90-day follow-up. Adults with early moderate to severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of Pao2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen of <150 mm Hg with a positive end-expiratory pressure of ≥8 cm H2O) were enrolled in 37 French intensive care units. Interventions: Patients were randomized to a strategy of inhaled sedation with sevoflurane (intervention group) or to a strategy of intravenous sedation with propofol (control group) for up to 7 days. Main outcomes and measures: The primary end point was the number of ventilator-free days at 28 days; the key secondary end point was 90-day survival. Results: Of 687 patients enrolled (mean [SD] age, 65 [12] years; 30% female), 346 were randomized to sevoflurane and 341 to propofol. The median total duration of sedation was 7 days (IQR, 4 to 7) in both groups. The number of ventilator-free days through day 28 was 0.0 days (IQR, 0.0 to 11.9) in the sevoflurane group and 0.0 days (IQR, 0.0 to 18.7) in the propofol group (median difference, -2.1 [95% CI, -3.6 to -0.7]; standardized hazard ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.97]). The 90-day survival rates were 47.1% and 55.7% in the sevoflurane and propofol groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.62]). Among 4 secondary outcomes, sevoflurane was associated with higher 7-day mortality (19.4% vs 13.5%, respectively; relative risk, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.02 to 2.03]) and fewer intensive care unit-free days through day 28 (median, 0.0 [IQR, 0.0 to 6.0] vs 0.0 [IQR, 0.0 to 15.0]; median difference, -2.5 [95% CI, -3.7 to -1.4]) compared with propofol. Conclusions and relevance: Among patients with moderate to severe ARDS, inhaled sedation with sevoflurane resulted in fewer ventilator-free days at day 28 and lower 90-day survival than sedation with propofol.

40074893	Spatial immune scoring system predicts hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence	Ahitsham Umar , Björn Nashan , Chen Ding , Cheng Sun, Denise Goh # , Felicia Wee , Fuling Li , Gengjie Jia, Gengjie Jia # , Jeffrey Chun Tatt Lim , Jiabei Wang , Joe Yeong , Lianxin Liu , Mengyuan Sun , Nye-Thane Ngo , Peiqi He # , Qingping Tao , Shuxia Hao , Tianli Dai # , Tony Kiat Hon Lim , Wei Wang , Yao Liu , Yongchang Zhang ,	Given the high recurrence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) post-resection1-3, improved early identification of patients at high risk for post-resection recurrence would help to improve patient outcomes and prioritize healthcare resources4-6. Here we observed a spatial and HCC recurrence-associated distribution of natural killer (NK) cells in the invasive front and tumour centre from 61 patients. Using extreme gradient boosting and inverse-variance weighting, we developed the tumour immune microenvironment spatial (TIMES) score based on the spatial expression patterns of five biomarkers (SPON2, ZFP36L2, ZFP36, VIM and HLA-DRB1) to predict HCC recurrence risk. The TIMES score (hazard ratio = 88.2, P < 0.001) outperformed current standard tools for patient risk stratification including the TNM and BCLC systems. We validated the model in 231 patients from five multicentred cohorts, achieving a real-world accuracy of 82.2% and specificity of 85.7%. The predictive power of these biomarkers emerged through the integration of their spatial distributions, rather than individual marker expression levels alone. In vivo models, including NK cell-specific Spon2-knockout mice, revealed that SPON2 enhances IFNγ secretion and NK cell infiltration at the invasive front. Our study introduces TIMES, a publicly accessible tool for predicting HCC recurrence risk, offering insights into its potential to inform treatment decisions for early-stage HCC.	12/03/2025
40063699	Genomic Characterization of High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma Reveals Distinct Somatic Features in Black Individuals	Aaron Atkinson , Casey S Greene , Chad D Huff , Courtney E Johnson , David A Nix , Jeffrey R Marks , Jennifer A Doherty, Joellen M Schildkraut , Katherine A Lawson-Michod, Katherine A Lawson-Michod , Lauren C Peres , Lindsay J Collin , Lucas A Salas , Natalie R Davidson , Yao Yu ,	Black individuals experience worse survival after a diagnosis of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) than White individuals and are underrepresented in ovarian cancer research. To date, the understanding of the molecular and genomic heterogeneity of HGSC is based primarily on the evaluation of tumors from White individuals. In the present study, we performed whole exome sequencing on HGSC samples from 211 Black patients to identify significantly mutated genes and characterize mutational signatures, assessing their distributions by gene expression subtypes. The occurrence and frequency of somatic mutations and signatures by self-reported race were compared to historical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Despite technical differences (e.g., formalin-fixed vs. fresh-frozen tissue), the distribution of mutations and their variant classifications for major HGSC genes were nearly identical across study populations. However, de novo significantly mutated gene analysis identified genes not previously reported in the TCGA analysis, including the oncogene KRAS and the potential tumor suppressor OBSCN. The prevalence of the homologous recombination deficiency signature was higher among Black individuals with the immunoreactive gene expression subtype compared with the mesenchymal and proliferative subtypes. These findings were confirmed by comparing the data from Black patients to 123 White patients with identical tissue collection and processing. Overall, this study suggests that, while most features of HGSC tumor phenotypes are similar in Black and White populations, there may be clinically-relevant differences. If validated, these phenotypes may be important for clinical decision-making and would have been missed by characterizing tumors from White individuals only.	10/03/2025
40098600	Optimal Vasopressin Initiation in Septic Shock: The OVISS Reinforcement Learning Study	Alexandre Kalimouttou, Alexandre Kalimouttou , Christopher W Seymour , Derek C Angus , Harvineet Singh , Jason N Kennedy , Jean Feng , Romain Pirracchio, Suchi Saria ,	Importance: Norepinephrine is the first-line vasopressor for patients with septic shock. When and whether a second agent, such as vasopressin, should be added is unknown. Objective: To derive and validate a reinforcement learning model to determine the optimal initiation rule for vasopressin in adult, critically ill patients receiving norepinephrine for septic shock. Design, setting, and participants: Reinforcement learning was used to generate the optimal rule for vasopressin initiation to improve short-term and hospital outcomes, using electronic health record data from 3608 patients who met the Sepsis-3 shock criteria at 5 California hospitals from 2012 to 2023. The rule was evaluated in 628 patients from the California dataset and 3 external datasets comprising 10 217 patients from 227 US hospitals, using weighted importance sampling and pooled logistic regression with inverse probability weighting. Exposures: Clinical, laboratory, and treatment variables grouped hourly for 120 hours in the electronic health record. Main outcome and measure: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: The derivation cohort (n = 3608) included 2075 men (57%) and had a median (IQR) age of 63 (56-70) years and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at shock onset of 5 (3-7 [range, 0-24, with higher scores associated with greater mortality]). The validation cohorts (n = 10 217) were 56% male (n = 5743) with a median (IQR) age of 67 (57-75) years and a SOFA score of 6 (4-9). In validation data, the model suggested vasopressin initiation in more patients (87% vs 31%), earlier relative to shock onset (median [IQR], 4 [1-8] vs 5 [1-14] hours), and at lower norepinephrine doses (median [IQR], 0.20 [0.08-0.45] vs 0.37 [0.17-0.69] µg/kg/min) compared with clinicians' actions. The rule was associated with a larger expected reward in validation data compared with clinician actions (weighted importance sampling difference, 31 [95% CI, 15-52]). The adjusted odds of hospital mortality were lower if vasopressin initiation was similar to the rule compared with different (odds ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.73-0.91]), a finding consistent across external validation sets. Conclusions and relevance: In adult patients with septic shock receiving norepinephrine, the use of vasopressin was variable. A reinforcement learning model developed and validated in several observational datasets recommended more frequent and earlier use of vasopressin than average care patterns and was associated with reduced mortality.	18/03/2025

The factors used to identify a malignant lesion and the best surgical technique are uncertain. In this context, the definition of high-volume center and expert surgeon is under debate. The Italian Society of Endoscopic Surgery and New Technologies (SICE) developed a nationwide survey to investigate the state-of-the-art of adrenal surgery in Italy. A web-based survey comprising 37 questions was developed and distributed to Italian surgeons involved in adrenal surgery. Two hundred forty-eight answers were analyzed. Consensus was reached among the survey participants regarding local infiltration (83%) and rapid growth of the lesion (81%) as markers of malignancy. Nearly 30% of the participants used MIS in case of malignant adrenal lesions. The lateral (50%) and anterior transperitoneal (44%) approaches were the most common among Italian surgeons. Approximately 40% of participants believe that 20-40 adrenalectomies/year are needed to define an expert surgeon and at least 20 procedures/year to define a high-volume center. Approximately half of participants performed < 10 adrenalectomies/year in centers with a median volume < 10 procedures/year. Based on participant feedback, this survey highlights local infiltration and rapid growth as the most significant markers of malignant adrenal lesions. While open adrenalectomy remains the gold standard for suspected malignant lesions, nearly 30% of the participants practice MIS even in these cases. The lateral and anterior transperitoneal approaches emerge as the most familiar for Italian surgeons. A substantial proportion of Italian patients with adrenal lesions undergo surgery performed by surgeons with an annual case volume < 10 procedures, at centers with a low annual volume of adrenalectomies. Moreover, there is a lack of standardized definitions for 'expert surgeon' and 'high-volume center' in this context.	17/03/2025
40099364	A Novel Hidden Protein p-414aa Encoded by circSETD2(14,15) Inhibits Vascular Remodeling	An-Qi Zhao # , Gang Liu , Jia-Jie Lin , Li-Yun Yang # , Miao Gong , Ming-Qi Zheng , Sen Wang , Shao-Guang Sun, Shu-Yan Yang , Si-Fan Wang, Si-Fan Wang # , Zhao-Yi Wang # ,	Background: Phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), leading to neointimal hyperplasia, is a fundamental cause of vascular remodeling diseases such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. Novel hidden proteins encoded by circular RNAs play crucial roles in disease progression, yet their involvement in vascular remodeling diseases has not been comprehensively studied. This study identifies a novel protein derived from a circular RNA in VSMCs and demonstrates its potential role in regulating vascular remodeling. Methods: Cell proliferation assays were performed to investigate the effects of circSETD2(14,15) on VSMC proliferation. Techniques such as vector construction, immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, and dual-luciferase reporter gene were used to confirm that circSETD2(14,15) encoded a novel protein, p-414aa. The interaction between p-414aa and HuR (human antigen R) was validated with techniques such as coimmunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and proximity ligation assay. Through experiments including RNA sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation, the interaction between HuR and C-FOS (C-Fos proto-oncogene) mRNA was revealed. The role of p-414aa in neointimal hyperplasia was assessed with a carotid artery ligation model in male mice. Results: Overexpression of circSETD2(14,15) inhibits VSMC phenotypic switching. The novel protein p-414aa, encoded by circSETD2(14,15), interacts with HuR to reduce C-FOS mRNA stability, thereby suppressing VSMC proliferation and ultimately inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia in male mice. Conclusions: We uncover a novel hidden protein derived from circSETD2(14,15), called p-414aa, that inhibits vascular remodeling. CircSETD2(14,15) and p-414aa may serve as potential therapeutic targets for vascular remodeling diseases.	18/03/2025

We here introduce the Farm Animal Genotype-Tissue Expression (FarmGTEx) Project, which aims to elucidate the genetic determinants of gene expression across 16 terrestrial and aquatic domestic species under diverse biological and environmental contexts. For each species, we aim to collect multiomics data, particularly genomics and transcriptomics, from 50 tissues of 1,000 healthy adults and 200 additional animals representing a specific context. This Perspective provides an overview of the priorities of FarmGTEx and advocates for coordinated strategies of data analysis and resource-sharing initiatives. FarmGTEx aims to serve as a platform for investigating context-specific regulatory effects, which will deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying complex phenotypes. The knowledge and insights provided by FarmGTEx will contribute to improving sustainable agriculture-based food systems, comparative biology and eventual human biomedicine.	17/03/2025
40097658	Design of sensitive monospecific and bispecific synthetic chimeric T cell receptors for cancer therapy	Andrew Stevens , Anusha Rajan , Arulmozhi Palani , Carla A Jaeger-Ruckstuhl , Grace Bugos # , James M Olson , Jason P Price , Kersten Heyer , Kirsten A Thompson , Longhui Zeng , Mitchell G Kluesner , Pinar A Atilla , Rachel Prins , Stanley R Riddell, Sylvain Simon, Sylvain Simon # , Tamer B Shabaneh , Xiaolei Su ,	The adoptive transfer of T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) is effective in B cell malignancies. However, the persistence of cancer cells with low levels or complete absence of the target antigen, thereby evading detection by CAR T cells, leads to relapse. These evasion mechanisms highlight the need for receptors with enhanced sensitivity and multispecificity. We introduce a synthetic chimeric T cell receptor (ChTCR) that confers superior antigen sensitivity compared with CARS and previous hybrid TCR designs and is readily adapted for bispecific targeting. ChTCRs replicate the structure of natural TCRs, form classical immune synapses and demonstrate TCR-like signaling. T cells expressing bispecific ChTCRs (Bi-ChTCRs) are more effective than bispecific CAR T cells in eradicating tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression in vivo in female mice. The Bi-ChTCR architecture is resilient and can be designed to target pairs of B cell and multiple myeloma antigens. These findings provide a widely applicable strategy to combat tumor heterogeneity and prevent relapse.	17/03/2025
40082695	A B7H3-targeting antibody-drug conjugate in advanced solid tumors: a phase 1/1b trial	Bihui Li , David Sommerhalder , Dongqing Lv , Hongyun Zhao, Jian Liu , Jiaqiang Cai , Jingao Li , Jinhui Xue # , Kunyu Yang , Li Zhang , Lin Wu , Mingjun Li , Peng Zhang , Seth Rosen , Shaodong Hong , Shen Zhao , Shujun Yang , Siqing Fu # , Song Qu , Steve Chin , Suxia Luo , Tongtong Xue , Wei Lian , Wenfeng Fang # , Wu Zhuang , Xian Zhang , Xiangjiao Meng # , Yan Huang # , Yang Zhang , Yanqiu Zhao , Yinghua Ji , Yuanyuan Zhao , Yulong Zheng , Yun Fan # , Yunpeng Yang # , Yuxiang Ma, Yuxiang Ma # , Zhihua Liu ,	Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a transformative modality in the treatment of solid tumors. YL201, a novel B7H3-targeting ADC, leverages a tumor microenvironment activable linker-payload platform, coupled with a novel topoisomerase 1 inhibitor via a protease-cleavable linker. Here we report the findings from a large-scale, global, multicenter, phase 1 trial evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of YL201 in patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapies. The trial included a dose-escalation part (phase 1) and a dose-expansion part (phase 1b). A total of 312 patients were enrolled across multiple tumor types, including extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and other solid tumors. The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 2.8 mg kg-1, and the recommended expansion dose was selected as 2.0 mg kg-1 and 2.4 mg kg-1 every 3 weeks. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events included neutropenia (31.7%), leukopenia (29.5%) and anemia (25.0%). Only 4 cases of interstitial lung disease (1.3%) and 1 case of infusion reactions (0.3%) were observed. Encouraging anti-tumor activity was observed, particularly in patients with ES-SCLC (objective response rate (ORR), 63.9%), NPC (ORR, 48.6%), lung adenocarcinoma (ORR, 28.6%) and lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (ORR, 54.2%). No significant correlation between B7H3 membrane expression and the ORR was found. YL201 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and a promising efficacy in heavily pretreated patients with advanced solid tumors, particularly in those with ES-SCLC, NPC or lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma. Phase 3 clinical trials for patients with SCLC and NPC have already been initiated. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT05434234 and NCT06057922 .	13/03/2025
40087409	The cyclic metabolic switching theory of intermittent fasting	Mark P Mattson, Mark P Mattson.	Intermittent fasting (IF) and ketogenic diets (KDs) have recently attracted much attention in the scientific literature and in popular culture and follow a longer history of exercise and caloric restriction (CR) research. Whereas IF involves cyclic metabolic switching (CMS) between ketogenic and non-ketogenic states, KDs and CR may not. In this Perspective, I postulate that the beneficial effects of IF result from alternating between activation of adaptive cellular stress response pathways during the fasting period, followed by cell growth and plasticity pathways during the feeding period. Thereby, I establish the cyclic metabolic switching (CMS) theory of IF. The health benefits of IF may go beyond those seen with continuous CR or KDs without CMS owing to the unique interplay between the signalling functions of the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate, mitochondrial adaptations, reciprocal activation of autophagy and mTOR pathways, endocrine and paracrine signalling, gut microbiota, and circadian biology. The CMS theory may have important implications for future basic research, clinical trials, development of pharmacological interventions, and healthy lifestyle practices.	14/03/2025
40087523	Maternal high-fat diet exacerbates atherosclerosis development in offspring through epigenetic memory	Cha Han , Ding Ai, Fangni Zhang # , Hongfeng Jiang , Huizhen Lv , Jian Zhang , Jie Du , Kan Li, Kan Li # , Meixi Quan , Meng Zhang , Ruixin Liu , Suya Bao , Weiqi Qian # , Weiyan Sun , Wenhui Zhang , Xinyi Cao , Yupeng Chen , Zhong Xian ,	Maternal exposure to a Western-type diet (WD) increases the susceptibility of adult offspring to atherosclerosis, partly because fetal endothelial cells (ECs) become dysfunctional and inflamed due to risk factors transmitted via maternal-fetal blood exchange. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that maternal WD accelerates atherogenesis in adult offspring mice by regulating chromatin dynamics through activator protein-1 (AP-1) in aortic ECs, inducing inflammatory memory at the chromatin level. We found that 27-hydroxycholesterol is involved in memory establishment and also acts as a secondary stimulator, amplifying the expression of inflammatory factors and enhancing the enrichment of AP-1/p300 and H3K27ac in ECs. Inhibiting AP-1 binding to chromatin reduced the inflammatory response in human umbilical vein ECs from mothers with hypercholesterolemia and decreased atherogenesis in offspring mice exposed to maternal WD. Our findings demonstrate that maternal WD exacerbates EC dysfunction and atherosclerosis in adult offspring by inducing AP-1-associated epigenetic memory, which increases chromatin accessibility to inflammatory genes.	14/03/2025

Methods: We analyzed data from CHB patients who initiated NAs from 30 centers (7 countries/regions). We balanced patient characteristics with and without metabolic disease (diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension) via propensity-score matching (PSM) to evaluate adverse liver events and motality. Results: The study included 4,500 CHB patients (54.6% with ≥1 metabolic disease). PSM yielded 909 pairs of patients with balanced characteristics. When stratified by the number of metabolic disease, only patients with ≥2 metabolic diseases had increased cumulative incidence of cirrhosis and overall death (but not HCC or cause-specific death). However, when stratified by the presence of diabetes (regardless of the presence or number of other metabolic diseases), patients with diabetes (vs. those without) had significantly higher cumulative incidence of all outcomes: cirrhosis (P=0.009), HCC (P=0.023), overall, liver-related and non-liver-related death (P<0.001, P=0.026 and P<0.001, respectively). On Cox regression analysis, having ≥2 metabolic diseases was associated with cirrhosis, overall death and non-liver-related death but not HCC and liver-related death, while diabetes was significantly associated with higher risk of all outcomes: cirrhosis (HR=3.75, P=0.004), HCC (HR=2.02, P=0.020), overall, liver-related and non-liver-related death (HR=2.53, P<0.001; HR=2.65, P=0.016; HR=2.38, P<0.001). Conclusion: Having ≥2 metabolic diseases was associated with significantly higher risk of cirrhosis, overall death and non-liver-related death, but having diabetes as a single metabolic disease was significantly associated with all adverse outcomes including cirrhosis, HCC, overall, liver-related and non-liver-related death.	17/03/2025
40087147	Effect of Helicobacter Pylori infection on immunotherapy for gastrointestinal cancer: a narrative review	Afroditi Ziogou, Afroditi Ziogou , Alexios Giannakodimos , Dimitrios Schizas , Ilias Giannakodimos , Nikolaos Charalampakis	Immunotherapy for gastrointestinal cancers has elicited considerable amount of attention as a viable therapeutic option for several cancer types. Gut microbiome as a whole plays a critical role in shaping immune responses and influencing cancer progression. Recent evidence suggests that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), may influence immunotherapy efficacy by modulating the tumor microenvironment. Infection with H. pylori is common as it affects approximately 50% of the global population and remains the leading risk factor for gastric cancer. Interestingly, recent clinical and preclinical data has associated H. pylori with colorectal cancer carcinogenesis. Gut microbiome appears to be a modulator of the relationship between the immune system, gastrointestinal cancer development and existing therapies. Infection with H. pylori may affect immunotherapy results in both gastroesophageal and colorectal cancer; favorable results were noticed in H. pylori positive patients with gastric cancer, while in colorectal cancer patients the pathogen seemed to impede immunotherapy's action. This article aims to review current data on the role of H. pylori in triggering gastric inflammation and cancer, as well as its potential involvement in colorectal cancer development. Additionally, it seeks to highlight the impact of H. pylori infection on the response to immunotherapy in gastrointestinal cancers.	20/03/2025
40097663	Molecular residual disease analysis of adjuvant osimertinib in resected EGFR-mutated stage IB-IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer	Aleksandra Markovets , Caitlin Muldoon , Christian Grohé , Dariusz M Kowalski , Jacqulyne Robichaux , Jonathan W Goldman , Konstantin Laktionov , Laura Bonanno , Manuel Dómine , Marcello Tiseo , Margarita Majem , Masahiro Tsuboi , Maurice Pérol , Mustafa Özgüroğlu , Myung-Ju Ahn , Preetida Bhetariya , Roy S Herbst, Roy S Herbst # , Ryan Hartmaier , Terufumi Kato , Thomas John # , Virote Sriuranpong , Yi-Long Wu, Yuri Rukazenkov ,	Osimertinib-a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor-is recommended as adjuvant therapy for resected stage IB-IIIA epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer, based on significant disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival improvement shown in the previously reported phase 3 ADAURA trial. A trend toward an increased DFS event rate after completion of 3 years adjuvant treatment in ADAURA suggests that some patients may benefit from longer adjuvant osimertinib treatment. We therefore explored whether tumor-informed, circulating tumor DNA-based, molecular residual disease (MRD) could predict recurrence in an exploratory post hoc analysis of 220 patients (n = 112 osimertinib; n = 108 placebo) from ADAURA. MRD preceded imaging DFS events in this study by a median of 4.7 (95% confidence interval, 2.2-5.6) months. DFS and MRD event-free rate at 36 months was 86% versus 36% for patients in the osimertinib versus placebo groups (hazard ratio, 0.23 (95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.36)). In the osimertinib group, DFS or MRD events were detected in 28 (25%) patients; most events occurred following osimertinib cessation (19 of 28, 68%) and within 12 months of stopping osimertinib (11 of 19, 58%). At 24 months after osimertinib, the DFS and MRD event-free rate was 66%. In this study, MRD preceded DFS events in most patients across both arms. DFS and MRD event-free status was maintained for most patients during adjuvant osimertinib treatment and posttreatment follow-up, with most MRD or DFS events occurring after osimertinib treatment discontinuation or completion. MRD detection could potentially identify patients who may benefit from longer adjuvant osimertinib, although this requires clinical confirmation.

However, their fibrosis-independent and homeostatic functions remain poorly understood1-5. Here we demonstrate that genetic depletion of HSCs changes WNT activity and zonation of hepatocytes, leading to marked alterations in liver regeneration, cytochrome P450 metabolism and injury. We identify R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), an HSC-enriched modulator of WNT signalling, as responsible for these hepatocyte-regulatory effects of HSCs. HSC-selective deletion of Rspo3 phenocopies the effects of HSC depletion on hepatocyte gene expression, zonation, liver size, regeneration and cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification, and exacerbates alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. RSPO3 expression decreases with HSC activation and is inversely associated with outcomes in patients with alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. These protective and hepatocyte-regulating functions of HSCs via RSPO3 resemble the R-spondin-expressing stromal niche in other organs and should be integrated into current therapeutic concepts.	12/03/2025
40089640	CBX3 promotes multidrug resistance by suppressing ferroptosis in colorectal carcinoma via the CUL3/NRF2/GPX2 axis	Guangyuan Xing , Hai Wang , Jiaofang Shao # , Jie Wang , Jin-Yong Zhou , Jinshun Pan, Min Ni , Min Wang , Tinghong Duan # , Xiaoming Bai, Xiaoming Bai # , Xue Liu , Yuanqiao He , Yutong Zhang , Zhi-Yuan Zhang ,	Chemoresistance poses a significant challenge in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. However, the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance remain unclear. CBX3 promoted proliferation and metastasis in CRC. However, the role and mechanism of CBX3 in chemoresistance remain unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of CBX3 on multidrug resistance in CRC. Our studies showed that higher levels of CBX3 expression were associated with poor survival, especially in groups with progression following chemotherapy. CBX3 overexpression increased Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin resistance, whereas CBX3 knockdown suppressed multidrug resistance in CRC cells. Additionally, CBX3 inhibited ferroptosis associated with multidrug resistance, and the ferroptosis activators prevented CBX3 overexpression-mediated cell survival. RNA sequencing revealed that the NRF2-signaling pathway was involved in this process. CBX3-upregulated NRF2 protein expression by directly binding to the promoter of Cullin3 (CUL3) to suppress CUL3 transcription and CUL3-mediated NRF2 degradation. Moreover, Glutathione Peroxidase 2 (GPX2) was downstream of the CBX3-NRF2 pathway in CRC chemoresistance. ML385, an NRF2 inhibitor, suppressed GPX2 expression, and increased ferroptosis in PDX models. Our study identified CBX3/NRF2/GPX2 axis may be a novel signaling pathway that mediates multidrug resistance in CRC. This study proposes developing novel strategies for cancer treatment to overcome drug resistance in the future.	16/03/2025
40097581	Nuclear and genome dynamics underlying DNA double-strand break repair	Gaëlle Legube , Irene Chiolo, Irene Chiolo , Karim Mekhail, Matthias Altmeyer ,	Changes in nuclear shape and in the spatial organization of chromosomes in the nucleus commonly occur in cancer, ageing and other clinical contexts that are characterized by increased DNA damage. However, the relationship between nuclear architecture, genome organization, chromosome stability and health remains poorly defined. Studies exploring the connections between the positioning and mobility of damaged DNA relative to various nuclear structures and genomic loci have revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic processes that affect chromosome stability. In this Review, we discuss the dynamic mechanisms that regulate nuclear and genome organization to promote DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, genome stability and cell survival. Genome dynamics that support DSB repair rely on chromatin states, repair-protein condensates, nuclear or cytoplasmic microtubules and actin filaments, kinesin or myosin motor proteins, the nuclear envelope, various nuclear compartments, chromosome topology, chromatin loop extrusion and diverse signalling cues. These processes are commonly altered in cancer and during natural or premature ageing. Indeed, the reshaping of the genome in nuclear space during DSB repair points to new avenues for therapeutic interventions that may take advantage of new cancer cell vulnerabilities or aim to reverse age-associated defects.	17/03/2025
40094679	Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: A Review	Elias Jabbour, Elias Jabbour , Hagop Kantarjian	Importance: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has an annual incidence of 2 cases per 100 000 people and is newly diagnosed in approximately 9300 individuals per year in the US. Approximately 150 000 people in the US and 5 million worldwide have CML. Observations: Chronic myeloid leukemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, which is defined by the BCR::ABL1 oncogene that develops after fusion of the ABL1 proto-oncogene to the constitutively active BCR gene. Approximately 90% of people with CML present with an indolent chronic phase of CML, defined as blasts of less than 10% in the blood or bone marrow, absence of extramedullary evidence of leukemia, basophils of less than 20%, and platelet counts of 100 to 1000 × 109/L. The most advanced stage is CML blastic phase (CML-BP), characterized by the World Health Organization as 20% or more blasts/immature cells and by the MD Anderson Cancer Center and European LeukemiaNet as 30% or more. Approximately 1% to 2% of patients with CML present with CML-BP. Since 2000, first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting BCR::ABL1, such as imatinib, and second-generation TKIs, such as bosutinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, have improved CML-related mortality from 10% to 20% per year to 1% to 2% per year, such that patients with CML have survival rates similar to those of a general age-matched population. Six BCR::ABL1 TKIs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, including 5 that are first-line treatment (imatinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, nilotinib, and asciminib) and 5 approved for treatment after disease progression despite initial therapy (dasatinib, bosutinib, nilotinib, ponatinib, asciminib). Effects on improved survival are similar with all TKIs, although more patients are able to promptly achieve and maintain BCR::ABL1 clearance with second- and third-generation TKIs. Medication adherence is important to maintain treatment responsiveness. All TKIs are associated with hematologic toxicity, such as myelosuppression, with additional agent-specific adverse effects, such as pleural effusion (dasatinib), arterio-occlusive events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease (nilotinib, ponatinib), gastrointestinal disturbance (bosutinib), or increased amylase and lipase with pancreatitis (ponatinib, asciminib, nilotinib). These adverse effects should be considered when selecting a TKI. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is a reasonably safe therapy, with cure rates ranging from 20% to 60% based on the stage of CML at the time of transplant. Stem cell transplant is reserved for patients with CML who do not respond to second-generation TKIs, those with intolerance to multiple TKIs, or those with accelerated-phase CML or CML-BP. Conclusions and relevance: Chronic myeloid leukemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm that can typically be effectively treated with TKIs, improving survival similar to that of a general age-matched population. Many patients require continuous TKI therapy. Therefore, TKI therapy should be selected with consideration of adverse effects, and patients should be helped to maximize adherence to TKI treatment.	17/03/2025
40088199	European Consensus on Malabsorption-UEG & SIGE, LGA, SPG, SRGH, CGS, ESPCG, EAGEN, ESPEN, and ESPGHAN: Part 2: Screening, Special Populations, Nutritional Goals, Supportive Care, Primary Care Perspective	Adrien Nicolau , Aleksejs Derovs , Anastasiou Foteini , Antonio Di Sabatino, Antonio Gasbarrini , Christos Lionis , Cristina Maria Sabo , Dan Lucian Dumitrascu , Denisa Kyselova , Gino Roberto Corazza , Gonçalo Nunes , Heinz Florian Hammer , Ilja Tacheci , Ilse Broekaert , Jernej Dolinsek , Johann Hammer , Jorge Fonseca , Juan Mendive , Juris Pokrotnieks , Jutta Keller , Loris Pironi , Lucrezia Laterza , Marc Sonyi , Marco Vincenzo Lenti, Marco Vincenzo Lenti , Marianna Arvanitakis , Oscar Segarra-Cantón , Rosa Burgos , Stephane Schneider , Teodora Surdea-Blaga , Željko Krznarić ,	Malabsorption is a complex and multifaceted condition characterised by the defective passage of nutrients into the blood and lymphatic streams. Several congenital or acquired disorders may cause either selective or global malabsorption in both children and adults, such as cystic fibrosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), coeliac disease (CD) and other enteropathies, lactase deficiency, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), autoimmune atrophic gastritis, Crohn's disease, and gastric or small bowel resections. Early recognition of malabsorption is key for tailoring a proper diagnostic work-up for identifying the cause of malabsorption. Patient's medical and pharmacological history are essential for identifying risk factors. Several examinations like endoscopy with small intestinal biopsies, non-invasive functional tests, and radiologic imaging are useful in diagnosing malabsorption. Due to its high prevalence, CD should always be looked for in case of malabsorption with no other obvious explanations and in high-risk individuals. Nutritional support is key in management of patients with malabsorption; different options are available, including oral supplements, enteral or parenteral nutrition. In patients with short bowel syndrome, teduglutide proved effective in reducing the need for parenteral nutrition, thus improving the quality of life of these patients. Primary care physicians have a central role in early detection of malabsorption and should be involved into multidisciplinary teams for improving the overall management of these patients. In this European consensus, involving 10 scientific societies and several experts, we have dissected all the issues around malabsorption, including the definitions and diagnostic testing (Part 1), high-risk categories and special populations, nutritional assessment and management, and primary care perspective (Part 2).	15/03/2025

Oncogene dosage variation contributes to cell-state transitions and phenotypic heterogeneity3, thereby providing a substrate for somatic evolution. Nonetheless, the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic heterogeneity are still poorly understood. Here we show that extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a major source of high-level focal amplification in key oncogenes and a major contributor of MYC heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We demonstrate that ecDNAs drive varying levels of MYC dosage, depending on their regulatory landscape, enabling cancer cells to rapidly and reversibly adapt to microenvironmental changes. In the absence of selective pressure, a high ecDNA copy number imposes a substantial fitness cost on PDAC cells. We also show that MYC dosage affects cell morphology and dependence of cancer cells on stromal niche factors. Our work provides a detailed analysis of ecDNAs in PDAC and describes a new genetic mechanism driving MYC heterogeneity in PDAC.	12/03/2025
40088380	DNA Methylation-Regulated ZDHHC13 Promotes the Progression of Parkinson's Disease	Jing Liao, Jing Liao , Liyuan Bei , Pengbing Nie , Pinjing Liu , Yongquan Zhang	Recent studies suggest that palmitoylation may influence proteins involved in neurotransmission and neurodegenerative changes, such as pathological α-synuclein. However, the role of palmitoylation in Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been systematically investigated. Additionally, findings on DNA methylation changes and PD-associated gene expression remain inconsistent. This study aims to explore the causal relationship and mechanisms between palmitoylation genes, DNA methylation, and PD using Mendelian Randomization (MR). This study employed two-sample MR analysis, summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analysis, and mediation analysis, utilizing PD GWAS data from the Finngen database, palmitoylation genes data from the eQTLGen database, and DNA methylation data from the GoDMC database. First, a two-sample MR analysis was used to evaluate the causal relationship between the palmitoylation genes and PD. Then, the SMR method was applied to validate the association between gene expression and PD. Finally, mediation analysis was conducted to explore the mediating effect of DNA methylation on the relationship between expression of palmitoylation genes and PD. Our study found a significant positive correlation between high expression of the ZDHHC13 gene and increased PD risk. Each 1 standard deviation increase in ZDHHC13 expression was associated with a 24.20% increase in PD risk. Further DNA methylation analysis identified two key methylation sites (cg00161556 and cg27379915), which indirectly influenced the occurrence of PD by regulating the expression of the ZDHHC13 gene. Mediation effect analysis revealed that the methylation sites cg00161556 and cg27379915 indirectly promoted the development of PD by regulating the expression of the ZDHHC13 gene, with the mediation effect of ZDHHC13 gene expression accounting for 63.72% and 57.61% of the total effect, respectively. Sensitivity analysis and SMR analysis supported our findings, indicating high statistical robustness. This study highlights the role of DNA methylation in regulating ZDHHC13 during PD progression, suggesting potential clinical applications such as ZDHHC13 as a biomarker or therapeutic target for early PD diagnosis and treatment.	15/03/2025

This policy is a milestone in China to mitigate serious air pollution. However, health benefits attributable to reduced fine-particulate air pollution after the implementation of the APPCAP have not been quantitatively estimated on a PM2.5 constituent-specific and morbidity cause-specific basis. Here we conducted a nationwide case-crossover study based on hospital admission records in 292 Chinese cities during 2013-2017. Compared with 2013, the annual average concentrations of PM2.5 and black carbon (BC) in 2017 decreased by 28.61% and 20.35%, respectively. As a result, the average relative reductions in annual attributable fractions of nine major cause-specific hospital admissions associated with PM2.5 and BC were 30.00% and 21.14%, respectively, among which annual attributable fraction for depression showed the largest reduction. Nationally, cities with higher reductions in PM2.5 and BC were found to have higher absolute reductions in annual hospital admission attributable fractions associated with PM2.5 and BC, and geographic inequality in health benefits still existed. Our study highlights the substantial wide-ranging health benefits of reduced PM2.5 and BC levels following the nationwide implementation of the APPCAP in China.	14/03/2025

However, clinical application is hindered by the need for safe, precise control systems to regulate local therapeutic payload expression and release. Here we developed a near-infrared (NIR) light-mediated PadC-based photoswitch (NETMAP) system based on a chimeric phytochrome-activated diguanylyl cyclase (PadC) and a cyclic diguanylate monophosphate-dependent transcriptional activator (MrkH). The NETMAP-engineered bacteria exhibited antitumor performance in mouse tumor models with different levels of immunogenicity. Specifically, in immunogenic lymphoma tumors, NIR-induced PD-L1 and CTLA-4 nanobodies enhanced the activation of adaptive immunity. In low-immunogenic tumors-including mouse-derived colon cancer models, an orthotopic human breast cancer cell line-derived xenograft model and a colorectal cancer patient-derived xenograft model-NIR-induced azurin and cytolysin A predominantly led to tumor inhibition. Our study identifies an NIR light-mediated therapeutic platform for engineered bacteria-based therapies with customizable outputs and precise dosage control.	17/03/2025

Fully understanding the cellular heterogeneity and immune adaptations in response to anti-PD-1 therapy is necessary to design more effective immunotherapies for GBM. This study aimed to dissect the molecular mechanisms of specific immunosuppressive subpopulations to drive anti-PD-1 resistance in GBM. Methods: We systematically analysed single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data from GBM tissues receiving anti-PD-1 therapy to characterize the microenvironment alterations. The biological functions of a novel circular RNA (circRNA) were validated both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, co-immunoprecipitation, RNA immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays were conducted. Results: Mesenchymal GBM (MES-GBM) cells, which were associated with a poor prognosis, and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1)+ myeloid-derived macrophages (SPP1+ MDMs), a unique subpopulation of MDMs with complex functions, preferentially accumulated in non-responders to anti-PD-1 therapy, indicating that MES-GBM cells and SPP1+ MDMs were the main anti-PD-1-resistant cell subpopulations. Functionally, we determined that circular RNA succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2 (circSDHAF2), which was positively associated with the abundance of these two anti-PD-1-resistant cell subpopulations, facilitated the formation of a regional MES-GBM and SPP1+ MDM cell interaction loop, resulting in a spatially specific adaptive immunosuppressive microenvironment. Mechanically, we found that circSDHAF2 promoted MES-GBM cell formation by stabilizing the integrin alpha 5 (ITGA5) protein through N-glycosylation. Meanwhile, the N-glycosylation of the ITGA5 protein facilitated its translocation into exosomes and subsequent delivery to MDMs to induce the formation of SPP1+ MDMs, which in turn maintained the MES-GBM cell status and induced T-cell dysfunction via the SPP1-ITGA5 pathway, ultimately promoting GBM immune escape. Importantly, our findings demonstrated that antibody-mediated ITGA5 blockade enhanced anti-PD-1-mediated antitumor immunity. Conclusions: This work elucidated the potential tissue adaptation mechanism of intratumoral dynamic interactions between MES-GBM cells, MDMs and T cells in anti-PD-1 non-responders and identified the therapeutic potential of targeting ITGA5 to reduce anti-PD-1 resistance in GBM.	14/03/2025
40101113	Leveraging artificial intelligence for neoantigen prediction	Haodong Xu , Jing Zeng, Jing Zeng , Tang Liu, Tao Zheng , Xianghong Zhang , Zhengjun Lin ,	Neoantigens represent a class of antigens within tumor microenvironments that arise from diverse somatic mutations and aberrations specific to tumorigenesis, holding substantial promise for advancing tumor immunotherapy. However, only a subset of neoantigens effectively elicits anti-tumor immune responses, and the specific neoantigens recognized by individual T cell receptors (TCRs) remain incompletely characterized. Therefore, substantial research has focused on screening immunogenic neoantigens, mainly through their major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation and TCR recognition specificity. Given the resource-intensiveness and inefficiency of experimental validation, predictive models based on artificial intelligence (AI) have gradually become mainstream methods to discover immunogenic neoantigens. Here, we provided a comprehensive summary of current AI methodologies for predicting neoantigens, with a particular focus on their capability to model peptide-MHC (pMHC) and pMHC-TCR binding. Furthermore, a thorough benchmarking analysis was conducted to assess the performance of antigen presentation predictors for scoring the immunogenicity of neoantigens. AI models have potential applications in the treatment of clinical diseases, although several limitations must first be overcome to realize their full potential. Anticipated advancements in data accessibility, algorithmic refinement, platform enhancement, and comprehensive validation of immune processes are poised to enhance the precision and utility of neoantigen prediction methodologies.	18/03/2025
40080840	Pre-B-Cell leukemia transcription factor 1 contributes to liver fibrosis by enabling IL-7 signaling in hepatic stellate cells	Aoqi Kang , Hao Li , Hong Liu , Jie Li , Ming Kong , Qianqian Chen , Qianwen Zhao, Qianwen Zhao , Wenjing Ren , Xingxing Han , Yong Xu , Yue Huan , Zhen Yang , Zilong Li	Background and aims: Liver fibrosis, when dysregulated, contributes to irreversible loss of hepatic structure and function heralding end-stage liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) represent the common progenitor to myofibroblasts that produce extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to mediate liver fibrosis. In the present study, we investigated the role of Pre-B-Cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1) in this process. Methods: Liver fibrosis was induced by CCl4 injection or bile duct ligation (BDL). Cellular transcriptome was examined by RNA-seq and CUT&Tag-seq. Results: PBX1 was screened out of mining through liver fibrosis-related single-cell RNA-seq datasets as the most prominently up-regulated transcription factor during HSC activation. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) coupled with reporter assay and ChIP assay demonstrated that Notch3 mediated elevation of PBX1 expression at the transcriptional level in HSCs. PBX1 knockdown attenuated HSC-myofibroblast transition in vitro and liver fibrosis in mice. Integrated transcriptomic analysis suggested that PBX1 contributed to HSC activation by activating a host of pro-fibrogenic molecules including interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R/CD127). Consistently, exposure to recombinant IL-7 promoted HSC activation whereas IL7R knockdown hampered HSC activation. Mechanistically, IL7R interacted with TGF-β receptors (TβRI/II) to trigger a pro-fibrogenic signaling cascade. Importantly, blockade of the IL-7-IL7R signaling with neutralizing antibodies markedly ameliorated liver fibrosis in mice. Finally, a positive correlation between PBX1, IL7R and HSC activation was identified in cirrhotic patients. Conclusions: Our data uncover a previously unappreciated role for PBX1 in HSC activation and provide proof-of-concept for targeting IL-7 signaling in the intervention of liver fibrosis.	13/03/2025
40085836	Regulation of the cGAS-STING Pathway	Andrea Ablasser, Bing Zhang, Bing Zhang , Pengbiao Xu ,	The cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway is essential for immune defense against pathogens. Upon binding DNA, cGAS synthesizes cGAMP, which activates STING, leading to potent innate immune effector responses. However, lacking specific features to distinguish between self and nonself DNA, cGAS-STING immunity requires precise regulation to prevent aberrant activation. Several safeguard mechanisms acting on different levels have evolved to maintain tolerance to self DNA and ensure immune homeostasis under normal conditions. Disruption of these safeguards can lead to erroneous activation by self DNA, resulting in inflammatory conditions but also favorable antitumor immunity. Insights into structural and cellular checkpoints that control and terminate cGAS-STING signaling are essential for comprehending and manipulating DNA-triggered innate immunity in health and disease.	14/03/2025
40087401	Utilizing ctDNA to discover mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies in patients with metastatic NSCLC: towards more informative trials	Adrianus J de Langen , Anne-Marie C Dingemans, Benjamin Besse , Christian Rolfo , Egbert F Smit , Hendrikus J Dubbink , Jan H von der Thüsen , Joachim G J V Aerts , Jordi Remon , Laura Mezquita , Marthe S Paats , Mihaela Aldea , Sanjay Popat , Sophie M Ernst, Sophie M Ernst ,	Advances in targeted therapies for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have substantially improved the outcomes of those with actionable alterations in certain oncogenic driver genes. However, acquired resistance to these targeted therapies remains a major challenge. Understanding the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance will be crucial for the development of strategies that might either overcome this effect or delay the onset. Circulating tumour DNA, owing to the need for only minimally invasive sampling and a potential role as both a prognostic and predictive biomarker, is increasingly being used in both research and clinical practice. Several studies have explored the landscape of acquired resistance to targeted therapies using this approach. However, the methodologies of the published studies vary widely, and several major challenges remain in addressing the practical difficulties associated with these methods. These challenges currently limit the depth of research insight provided by the available data. In this Perspective, we review clinical reports describing the use of circulating tumour DNA to detect mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies, predominantly in patients with advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer, and highlight key unresolved questions with the aim of moving towards more-informative research studies.	14/03/2025
40082619	Interleukin-12 signaling drives Alzheimer's disease pathology through disrupting neuronal and oligodendrocyte homeostasis	Anastasiya Boltengagen , Andreas J Hülsmeier , Burkhard Becher , Caroline Braeuning , Christine Kocks , Ekaterina Friebel , Frank L Heppner #, Jan Schmoranzer , Julia M Edgar , Juliane Obst , Klaus-Armin Nave , Maria N Geesdorf # , Marina Jendrach , Marlene Foerster , Myrto Andreadou , Niclas Gimber , Nikolaus Rajewsky # , Nikos Karaiskos , Pascale Eede , Sarah Mundt , Seung Joon Kim # , Shirin Schneeberger, Shirin Schneeberger # , Stefan Prokop , Tanja Kuhlmann , Thorsten Hornemann , Torben Ruhwedel , Wiebke Kessler , Wiebke Möbius ,	Neuroinflammation including interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23-signaling is central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Inhibition of p40, a subunit of IL-12/IL-23, attenuates pathology in AD-like mice; however, its signaling mechanism and expression pattern remained elusive. Here we show that IL-12 receptors are predominantly expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes in AD-like APPPS1 mice and in patients with AD, whereas IL-23 receptor transcripts are barely detectable. Consistently, deletion of the IL-12 receptor in neuroectodermal cells ameliorated AD pathology in APPPS1 mice, whereas removal of IL-23 receptors had no effect. Genetic ablation of IL-12 signaling alone reverted the loss of mature oligodendrocytes, restored myelin homeostasis, rescued the amyloid-β-dependent reduction of parvalbumin-positive interneurons and restored phagocytosis-related changes in microglia of APPPS1 mice. Furthermore, IL-12 protein expression was increased in human AD brains compared to healthy age-matched controls, and human oligodendrocyte-like cells responded profoundly to IL-12 stimulation. We conclude that oligodendroglial and neuronal IL-12 signaling, but not IL-23 signaling, are key in orchestrating AD-related neuroimmune crosstalk and that IL-12 represents an attractive therapeutic target in AD.	13/03/2025
40101158	Single Cell Expression Analysis of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ Identifies Complex Genotypic-Phenotypic Relationships Altering Epithelial Composition	Aashrith Saraswathibhatla , Allison Hall , ChunFang Zhu , David G P van IJzendoorn , E Shelley Hwang , Graham A Colditz , Jeffrey R Marks , Kouros Owzar , Lorraine King , Lunden Simpson , Marissa R Lee , Ovijit Chaudhuri , Rachel E Factor , Robert B West, Shu Jiang , Siri H Strand , Sujay Vennam , Sushama Varma , Xiaodi Qin, Xiaodi Qin , Xiaoke Luo ,	Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a risk factor for subsequent invasive breast cancer. To identify events in DCIS that lead to invasive cancer, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) on DCIS lesions and matched normal breast tissue. Inferred copy number variation (CNV) was used to identify neoplastic epithelial cells from clinical specimens, which contained a mixture of DCIS and normal ducts. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated intratumoral clonal heterogeneity that was associated with significant gene expression differences. Classification of epithelial cells into mammary cell states revealed that subclones contained a mixture of cell states, suggesting an ongoing pattern of differentiation after neoplastic transformation. Cell state proportions were significantly different based on estrogen receptor (ER) expression with ER-negative DCIS more closely resembling the distribution in the normal breast, particularly with respect to cells with basal characteristics. Specific alterations in cell state proportions were associated with progression to invasive cancer in a cohort of DCIS with longitudinal outcome. Ongoing transcription of key basement membrane (BM) genes occurred in specific subsets of epithelial cell states, including basal/myoepithelial, which are diminished in DCIS. In the transition to invasive breast cancer, the BM protein laminin, but not COL4, was altered in DCIS adjacent to invasion. Loss of COL4, but not laminin, in an in vitro DCIS model led to an invasive phenotype. These findings suggest that the process of invasion is a loss-of-function event due to an imbalance in critical cell populations essential for BM integrity rather than a gain of an invasive phenotype by neoplastic cells.	18/03/2025
40089653	Comprehensive Brain-wide Mapping of Afferent and Efferent Nuclei Associated with the Heart in the Mouse	Congye Li , Haiying Liu, Haiying Liu # , Honghui Mao , Qian Liu , Ruixin Xia # , Shengxi Wu, Wenting Wang , Xin Huang # , Xin Zhao , Zimeng Li ,	Normal heart function depends on complex regulation by the brain, and abnormalities in the brain‒heart axis affect various diseases, such as myocardial infarction and anxiety disorders. However, systematic tracking of the brain regions associated with the input and output of the heart is lacking. In this study, we injected retrograde transsynaptic pseudorabies virus (PRV) and anterograde transsynaptic herpes simplex virus (HSV) into the left ventricular wall of mice to identify the whole-brain regions associated with the input to and output from the heart. We successfully detected PRV and HSV expression in at least 170 brain subregions in both male and female mice. Sex differences were discovered mainly in the hypothalamus and medulla, with male mice exhibiting greater correlation and hierarchical clustering than female mice, indicating reduced similarity and increased modularity of virus expression patterns in male mice. Further graph theory and multiple linear regression analysis of different injection timelines revealed that hub regions of PRV had highly similar clusters, with different brain levels, suggesting a top-down, hierarchically transmitted neural control pattern of the heart. Hub regions of HSV had scattered clusters, with brain regions gathered in the cortex and brainstem, suggesting a bottom-up, leapfrog, multipoint neural sensing pattern of the heart. Both patterns contain many hub brain regions that have been previously overlooked in brain‒heart axis studies. These results provide brain targets for future research and will lead to deeper insight into the brain mechanisms involved in specific heart conditions.	15/03/2025
40079144	March2 Alleviates Aortic Aneurysm/Dissection by Regulating PKM2 Polymerization	Haoran Chen , Jie Lin , Jun Ren , Junbo Ge , Lin Wu , Ling Lin , Litao Wang # , Lixin Wang , Qijun Zheng , Rongjun Zou , Shengjun Xiong , Shuolin Liu # , Tingfang Zhu , Yayu Wang , Yingmei Zhang, Yiran E Li, Yiran E Li # , Yuxin Du # , Zheyun Li ,	Background: Aortic aneurysm/dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening disease lacking effective pharmacological treatment. Protein ubiquitination plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular diseases. However, the possible contribution of the E3 ubiquitin ligase March2 (membrane-associated RING finger protein 2) to the cause of AAD remains elusive. Methods: Integrated single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was conducted in human AAD tissues. Based on the screening results, we generated a mouse line of smooth muscle cell-specific March2 knockout. β-Aminopropionitrile monofumarate was used to establish AAD. Cleavage under targets and tagmentation and cleavage under targets and tagmentation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed to identify possible target genes for histone H3K18 lactylation. Results: March2 expression was downregulated in aorta from patients with AAD or β-aminopropionitrile monofumarate-induced AAD mice. β-Aminopropionitrile monofumarate-induced AAD was significantly accentuated in March2 global (March2-/-) and vascular smooth muscle cell-specific deletion (March2fl/fl; TaglnCre) mice, whereas the AAD pathology was rescued by rAAV9-SM22α-March2 (recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 expressing Flag-tagged March2 under SM22α promoter). March2 interacted with PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) to promote K33-linked polyubiquitination. Deficiency of March2 lessened PKM2 dimer-to-tetramer conversion in AAD and overtly exacerbated AAD-induced histone H3K18 lactylation in vascular smooth muscle cells by fostering glucose metabolism reprogramming, thereby promoting p53-driven apoptotic transcriptional response-a hallmark of AAD pathogenesis. TEPP-46, a PKM2-specific activator, pronouncedly alleviated March2 deficiency-deteriorated AAD pathology. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that March2 is a novel endogenous defender that prevents AAD by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis, suggesting that March2 represents a potential therapeutic target for AAD.	13/03/2025
40099370	Nrf3-Mediated Mitochondrial Superoxide Promotes Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis and Impairs Cardiac Functions by Suppressing Pitx2	Ancheng Zheng # , Haige Zhao , Leyu Wang , Li Zhang #, Mei Yang , Qingzhong Xiao # , Qishan Chen, Qishan Chen # , Shasha Sun , Xiaolei Xu # , Yumeng Wang , Zhenning Shi ,	Background: Myocardial infarction (MI) elicits mitochondria reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cardiomyocyte (CM) apoptosis. Nrf3 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 3) has an established role in regulating redox signaling and tissue homeostasis. Here, we aimed to evaluate the role and mechanism of Nrf3 in injury-induced pathological cardiac remodeling. Methods: Global (Nrf3-KO) and CM-specific (Nrf3△CM) Nrf3 knockout mice were subjected to MI or ischemia/reperfusion injury, followed by functional and histopathological analysis. Primary neonatal mouse and rat ventricular myocytes and CMs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells were used to evaluate the impact of Nrf3 on CM apoptosis and mitochondrial ROS production. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis were used to uncover potential targets of Nrf3. MitoParaquat administration and CM-specific adeno-associated virus vectors were used to further confirm the in vivo relevance of the identified signal pathways. Results: Nrf3 was expressed mainly in CMs in healthy human hearts, and an increased level of Nrf3 was observed in CMs within the border zone of infarcted human hearts and murine cardiac tissues after MI. Both global and CM-specific Nrf3 knockout significantly decreased injury-induced mitochondrial ROS production, CM apoptosis, and pathological cardiac remodeling, consequently improving cardiac functions. In addition, cardiac-specific Nrf3 overexpression reversed the ameliorative cardiac phenotypes observed in Nrf3-KO mice. Functional studies showed that Nrf3 promoted neonatal mouse ventricular myocyte, neonatal rat ventricular myocyte, and CMs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell apoptosis by increasing mitochondrial ROS production. Critically, augmenting mitochondrial ROS with MitoParaquat blunted the beneficial effects of Nrf3 deletion on cardiac function and remodeling. Mechanistically, a redox regulator Pitx2 (paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2) was identified as one of the main target genes of Nrf3. Specifically, Nrf3 binds to Pitx2 promoter, where it increases DNA methylation through recruiting heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K and DNA-methyltransferase 1 complex, thereby inhibiting Pitx2 expression. CM-specific knockdown of Pitx2 blunted the beneficial effects of Nrf3 deletion on cardiac function and remodeling, and cardiac-specific Pitx2 overexpression attenuated MI-induced mitochondrial ROS production and CM apoptosis, as well as preserved cardiac functions after MI. Conclusions: Nrf3 promotes injury-induced CM apoptosis and deteriorates cardiac functions by increasing mitochondrial ROS production through suppressing Pitx2 expression. Targeting the Nrf3-Pitx2-mitochondrial ROS signal axis may therefore represent a novel therapeutic approach for MI treatment.	18/03/2025
40087539	Post-translational modifications orchestrate the intrinsic signaling bias of GPR52	Bingjie Zhang, Bingjie Zhang , Boxun Lu , Guang Yang , Huilan Wang , Jie Yu , Jingwen Li , Mengna Ma , Qingrun Li , Rong Zeng , Shanshan Li , Wei Ge , Wenqing Shui	Despite recent advances in G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) biology, the regulation of GPCR activation, signaling and function by post-translational modifications (PTMs) remains largely unexplored. In this study of GPR52, an orphan GPCR with exceedingly high constitutive G-protein activity that is emerging as a neurotherapeutic target, we discovered its disproportionately low arrestin recruitment activity. After profiling the N-glycosylation and phosphorylation patterns, we found that these two types of PTMs differentially shape the intrinsic signaling bias of GPR52. While N-terminal N-glycosylation promotes constitutive Gs signaling possibly through favoring the self-activating conformation, phosphorylation in helix 8, to our great surprise, suppresses arrestin recruitment and attenuates receptor internalization. In addition, we uncovered the counteracting roles of N-glycosylation and phosphorylation in modulating GPR52-dependent accumulation of the huntingtin protein in brain striatal cells. Our study provides new insights into the regulation of intrinsic signaling bias and cellular function of an orphan GPCR through distinct PTMs in different motifs.	14/03/2025

Although genetic associations with amygdala volumetric traits have been investigated in sex-combined European populations, cross-ancestry and sex-stratified analyses are lacking. Here we conducted cross-ancestry and sex-stratified genome-wide association analyses for 21 amygdala volumetric traits in 6,923 Chinese and 48,634 European individuals. We identified 191 variant-trait associations (P < 2.38 × 10-9), including 47 new associations (12 new loci) in sex-combined univariate analyses and seven additional new loci in sex-combined and sex-stratified multivariate analyses. We identified 12 ancestry-specific and two sex-specific associations. The identified genetic variants include 16 fine-mapped causal variants and regulate amygdala and fetal brain gene expression. The variants were enriched for brain development and colocalized with mood, cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders. These results indicate that cross-ancestry and sex-stratified genetic association analyses may provide insight into the genetic architectures of amygdala and subnucleus volumes.	17/03/2025

This analysis aimed to describe the outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks after starting cenobamate therapy in a real-world setting. Methods: BLESS [NCT05859854] is an ongoing, observational, retrospective and prospective cohort study to evaluate the real-world effectiveness and safety of adjunctive cenobamate in adults with uncontrolled focal epilepsy. Subgroup analysis was performed in subjects with 2 to 3 previous ASMs (early users) and those with >3 previous ASMs (late users). Results: The second interim analysis of the BLESS study included 388 participants with a median (interquartile range) age of 43.0 (31.0-54.0) years. They had a median of 6.0 (4.0-9.0) prior ASMs and a median of 7.2 (3.0-20.6) monthly seizures at baseline. The median monthly seizure frequency was reduced by 59.9% (19.2%-87.3%) from baseline to 24 weeks; 229 (59.0%) subjects had a ≥50% seizure frequency reduction, and 44 (11.3%) showed sustained seizure freedom. The proportion of participants taking ≤2 concomitant ASMs increased from 217 (56.5%) at baseline to 239 (65.7%) at 24 weeks. Among the early users (n = 76, 19.6%), the median reduction in monthly seizure frequency at 24 weeks was 78.0% (50.0-97.1%), and 76.3% of subjects had a ≥50% response rate. The frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was 5.3% and 23.4% in early and late users. The most frequent ADRs were somnolence, dizziness, and balance disorder; after the occurrence of ADRs, 63.5% of participants maintained the prescribed dose, and 5.2% permanently discontinued treatment. Significance: Cenobamate was effective in reducing seizure frequency in a real-world setting and showed a manageable safety profile. The treatment with cenobamate also reduced the burden of concomitant ASMs in both early and late users.	15/03/2025
40087536	De novo design of self-assembling peptides with antimicrobial activity guided by deep learning	Bihan Wu , Dinghao Chen , Hongyue Zhang , Huaimin Wang, Huayang Liu, Huayang Liu # , Jing Huang , Sangshuang Li , Xinping Feng , Yu Zhang , Ziao Zhou , Zilin Song # ,	Bioinspired materials based on self-assembling peptides are promising for tackling various challenges in biomedical engineering. While contemporary data-driven approaches have led to the discovery of self-assembling peptides with various structures and properties, predicting the functionalities of these materials is still challenging. Here we describe the deep learning-guided de novo design of antimicrobial materials based on self-assembling peptides targeting bacterial membranes to address the emerging problem of bacterial drug resistance. Our approach integrates non-natural amino acids for enhanced peptide self-assembly and effectively predicts the functional activity of the self-assembling peptide materials with minimal experimental annotation. The designed self-assembling peptide leader displays excellent in vivo therapeutic efficacy against intestinal bacterial infection in mice. Moreover, it exhibits an enhanced biofilm eradication capability and does not induce acquired drug resistance. Mechanistic studies reveal that the designed peptide can self-assemble on bacterial membranes to form nanofibrous structures for killing multidrug-resistant bacteria. This work thus provides a strategy to discover functional peptide materials by customized design.	14/03/2025
40087139	Stem Cells from Human Exfoliated Deciduous Teeth-Derived Exosomes for the Treatment of Acute Liver Injury and Liver Fibrosis	Danyang Zhong , Enjie Zhou , Jianing Yan , Qiang Zheng , Tingting Yan , Xiaoyan He , Xiujun Cai, Yifan Wang , Yu Liu , Yuyang Yuan , Zhichao Ye , Ziyuan Wang, Ziyuan Wang ,	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play a crucial role in regenerative medicine due to their regenerative potential. However, traditional MSC-based therapies are hindered by issues such as microvascular obstruction and low cell survival after transplantation. Exosomes derived from MSCs (MSC-Exo) provide a cell-free, nanoscale alternative, mitigating these risks and offering therapeutic potential for liver diseases. Nonetheless, the functional variability of MSCs from different sources complicates their clinical application. Stem cells derived from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) offer advantages such as ease of procurement and robust proliferative capacity, but their secretome, particularly SHED-Exo, remains underexplored in the context of liver disease therapy. This study analyzed MSC-Exo from various sources via small RNA sequencing to identify differences in microRNA profiles, aiding in the selection of optimal MSC sources for clinical use. SHED-Exo was subsequently tested in an acute liver injury model, showing notable regenerative effects, including enhanced hepatocyte proliferation, macrophage polarization, and reduced inflammation. Despite strong liver-targeting properties, the rapid hepatic clearance of SHED-Exo limits its effectiveness in chronic liver diseases. To address this challenge, a GelMA-based hydrogel was developed for in situ delivery, ensuring sustained release and enhanced antifibrotic efficacy, providing a promising strategy for chronic liver disease management.	14/03/2025

Antipsychotics are associated with QT interval prolongation, which is a risk factor for arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. The differences between antipsychotic with regard to QT interval prolongation are not well understood. Objective: The aim was to compare the QT values associated with different antipsychotics within a real-world population of subjects with clinically stable forms of schizophrenia. Methods: The FACE-SZ cohort comprises subjects with psychotic disorders, referred to schizophrenia expert cents. QT interval was measured, as well as all treatments (psychotropic and others). The following maintenance treatment for schizophrenia was analysed cross-sectionally: aripiprazole, clozapine, haloperidol, amisulpride, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone. Age, sex, smoking status, body mass index, blood potassium levels, and the co-prescription of another QT-prolonging treatment were used as adjustment factors in multivariable linear regression analyses. Results: Among 792 patients, the mean corrected QT (QTc) interval in the sample of patients under monotherapy was 407 ms. The mean age was 31.7 years, and the majority were male (73.3 %). In comparison to the rest of the sample, clozapine was associated with a longer QTc interval (β = 0.012, 95% CI [0.006-0.018]), while aripiprazole was significantly associated with a shorter QTc interval (β = - 0.010, 95% CI [- 0.016 to - 0.005]). Other antipsychotics were not associated with significant variations of the QTc. Conclusions: The prescription of antipsychotics should always be accompanied by close monitoring of the QTc interval to prevent the risk of severe cardiac arrhythmia, particularly concerning clozapine.	15/03/2025

40087402	Emerging importance of HER3 in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy	Helena Yu, Joan T Garrett, Joan T Garrett , Mary Kate Kilroy , Salomon Tendler , Wasim Feroz ,	HER3 is a member of the HER/ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, together with EGFR (HER1), HER2 and HER4. Despite having only weak intrinsic kinase activity, HER3 can contribute to oncogenic signalling via ligand-induced heterodimerization with other HER family members. Evidence indicates that HER3 is altered or aberrantly expressed across a variety of tumour types and can be associated with poor clinical outcomes. Whereas anticancer agents targeting EGFR and HER2 have been approved for decades, no drug targeting HER3 had been approved until very recently. Initial targeting of HER3 with monoclonal antibodies as single agents or in combination with other therapeutics produced disappointing clinical results. Subsequently, efforts have been made to target HER3 with novel agents such as antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies, with promising efficacy observed in several trials encompassing various tumour types. In December 2024, the HER3 × HER2 bispecific antibody zenocutuzumab was granted FDA Accelerated Approval for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancers or pancreatic cancers harbouring fusions involving NRG1, the gene encoding the high-affinity HER3 ligand neuregulin 1. In this Review, we provide an essential guide to HER3 signalling and oncogenesis, HER3 expression in cancer and its prognostic implications, oncogenic HER3 somatic mutations as well as rare NRG1 fusions that might depend on HER3 signalling, and the roles of HER3 in resistance to cancer therapies. We also highlight efforts to target HER3 with diverse therapeutic strategies and the potential interplay between HER3 and the antitumour immune response.	14/03/2025

MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion2 and systemic hyperinflammation3. The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown. Here we show that acute MIS-C is characterized by impaired reactivation of virus-reactive memory T cells, which depends on increased serum levels of the cytokine TGFβ resembling those that occur during severe COVID-19 (refs. 4,5). This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation.	12/03/2025
40096692	Acute Pain Management in People With Opioid Use Disorder : A Systematic Review	Alyssa A Grimshaw , Daniel P Alford , Joanna L Starrels , Katherine Mackey , Laila Khalid , Max Moss , Melissa B Weimer, Michele J Buonora, Michele J Buonora , Thomas R Hickey , William C Becker ,	Background: Guidance on acute pain management among people with opioid use disorder (OUD) is limited. Purpose: To synthesize evidence on the benefits and harms of acute pain interventions among people with OUD. Data sources: APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, APA PsycExtra, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science Core Collection through 7 July 2024. Study selection: Studies of any design that evaluated acute pain interventions among adults with OUD and included pain or OUD outcomes. Data extraction: Independent dual screening, single-investigator data extraction with verification, and dual quality and strength of evidence assessment. Data synthesis: Seventeen trials, 20 controlled observational studies, and 78 uncontrolled observational studies met eligibility criteria. Continuing use of buprenorphine during acute pain episodes may be associated with similar or improved pain-related outcomes versus discontinuing, based on cohort studies conducted primarily in perioperative settings. Single well-conducted randomized controlled trials in emergency department (ED) or perioperative settings in adults not prescribed medications for OUD suggest oral clonidine, intramuscular haloperidol and midazolam with intravenous (IV) morphine, and intraoperative IV lidocaine may improve pain outcomes and warrant study in diverse patient populations. Few studies evaluated methadone or the effect of interventions on OUD outcomes. Limitations: Most evidence is observational and at risk of bias due to confounding. All studies were conducted in ED or hospital settings, most before widespread use of high-potency synthetic opioids or among non-U.S. populations using opium. Conclusion: The overall evidence for pain outcomes in people with OUD is low. The effect of pain interventions on OUD outcomes is an important evidence gap. Primary funding source: None.

40084945	HLA-DQB1*03:01 and risk of Hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma	Allan Hildesheim , Bin Zhu , Chien-Jen Chen , Chih-Jen Huang , Deke Jiang , Hai-Tao Chen , Hwai-I Yang , Mary Carrington , Mathias Viard , Mei-Hsuan Lee , Mei-Hung Pan , Ruth M Pfeiffer , Ting Zhang, Ting Zhang , Tobias L Lenz , Yu-Han Huang , Zhiwei Liu	Background aims: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. We investigated associations of HLA variants, amino acid polymorphisms, zygosity, and evolutionary divergence (HED) with HBV-related HCC in Han Chinese and explored biological mechanisms. Approach results: We examined the associations of HLA variants (imputed 4-digit classical alleles and amino acid polymorphisms), zygosity, and HED with HBV-related HCC in a discovery set (706 HBV-related HCC cases, 6,197 chronic HBV carriers in Taiwan). Significant signals were validated in independent set (636 cases, 560 controls in Qidong, PR China). We used logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, and top 10 genetic principal components, with a Bonferroni-correction for multiple testing (p<1.6×10-4). We evaluated predicted peptide-binding affinities and control of viral load, viral population diversity, and inflammatory markers for significant signals. HLA-DQB1*03:01 was most significantly associated with HBV-related HCC in discovery and validation sets (ORmeta-analysis=1.33, Pmeta-analysis=2.6×10-8). Three amino acids within DQβ1 peptide-binding region, HLA-DQβ1Ala13, HLA-DQβ1Tyr26, and HLA-DQβ1Glu45, were positively associated with HCC. HLA-DQB1*03:01 was associated with lower binding affinity of HBV nucleocapsid antigen and higher HBV DNA load and serum soluble programmed cell death 1 (sPD-1) (P<0.05). HLA-DQB1 heterozygosity was inversely associated with HCC independent of HLA-DQB1*03:01 (Pmeta-analysis=3.3×10-3). Conclusions: HLA-DQB1*03:01 and its three key amino acids are associated with an increased HBV-related HCC risk. This association may be explained by the low binding affinity to HBV antigen, resulting in poor control of viral load and increased inflammation, as evidenced by sPD-1 levels.	14/03/2025

Here primary analysis of the diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cohort is reported. Patients received intravenous odronextamab in 21-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicity, with cycle 1 step-up dosing to mitigate cytokine release syndrome (CRS) risk. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included complete response (CR) rate, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. A total of 127 patients were enrolled. At the 29.9-month efficacy follow-up, the ORR was 52.0% and CR rate was 31.5%. Median durations of response and CR were 10.2 and 17.9 months, respectively. Undetectable minimal residual disease at cycle 4 day 15 was associated with PFS benefit. With a step-up of 0.7 to 4 to 20 mg (n = 60), CRS was the most common treatment-emergent adverse event (53.3% (grade ≥3, 1.7%)). No immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome was reported. Infections were reported in 82/127 (64.6%) patients (grade ≥3, 38.6%; coronavirus disease 2019, 18.1% (grade ≥3, 12.6%)). In conclusion, odronextamab showed encouraging efficacy in heavily pretreated R/R DLBCL and generally manageable safety with supportive care. Clinical trial registration: NCT03888105 .	17/03/2025
40101766	Structures and mechanism of human mitochondrial pyruvate carrier	Ailong Song # , Dan Ma, Gaoxingyu Huang , Jiaming Liang, Jiaming Liang # , Junhui Shi # , Kairan Zhang , Meihua Lu , Meng Xu , Peilong Lu , Xudong Wu ,	Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein complex essential for uptake of pyruvate into matrix as the primary carbon source for tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle1,2. Here, we report six cryo-EM structures of human MPC in three different states: three structures obtained at different conditions in intermembrane space (IMS)-open state with highest resolution of 3.2 Å, a structure of pyruvate-treated MPC in occluded state at 3.7 Å, and two structures in matrix-facing state bound with the inhibitor UK5099 or an inhibitory nanobody on the matrix side at 3.2 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively. MPC is assigned into a heterodimer consisting of MPC1 and MPC2, with the transmembrane domain adopting pseudo-C2-symmetry. Approximate rigid body movements occur between the IMS-open state and the occluded state, while structural changes primarily on the matrix side facilitate the transition between the occluded state and the matrix-facing state, revealing the alternating access mechanism during pyruvate transport. In the UK5099-bound structure, the inhibitor fits well and interacts extensively with a pocket that opens to the matrix side. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying MPC-mediated substrate transport, and the recognition and inhibition by UK5099, which will facilitate future drug development targeting MPC.	18/03/2025

Diagnosis and management of CI in real life remain challenging. The aim of the survey is to evaluate on a national scale the multidisciplinary management of these patients. 24-item online Survey was sent to the mailing lists and social media of Italian Society of Endoscopic Surgery and New Technologies, Italian Society of Digestive Endoscopy, World Society of Emergency Surgery-Italy Chapter, and Italian Society of Surgical Endoscopy and Digestive Diseases. Overall, 240 subjects answered to the survey, corresponding to 22.1% of the total members of the scientific societies involved. 131 (54.5%) respondents evaluated fewer than ten CI patients per year. The recommendations provided by the WSES and SIED guidelines were followed by 133 (55.2%) and 83 (34.4%) participants, respectively. Emergency surgery was advocated by 180 (77.6%) of the respondents for patients with transmural necrosis or signs of perforation, using minimally invasive surgery in 47% of the cases and considering initial esophagojejunal anastomosis as safe in 33 (14.2%) of the responses. Our study is the first to provide real-life data on how the management of CI varies across Italian physicians, according to regional, institutional, and specialty-related factors. This survey highlights the need for standardized and uniform guidelines.	13/03/2025
40087516	Social disadvantage accelerates aging	Acer Blake , Archana Singh-Manoux , Fangyu Liu , Jaana Pentti , Joni V Lindbohm, Jussi Vahtera , Keenan A Walker , Linda Partridge , Mika Kivimäki, Mika Kivimäki , Philipp Frank , Solja T Nyberg , Tony Wyss-Coray ,	Social disadvantage, like advanced age, is a risk factor for a broad range of health conditions; however, whether it influences the aging process remains unclear. Here, using a multicohort approach, we investigated the associations of social disadvantage with age-related plasma proteins and age-related diseases. We found proteomic signatures of accelerated immune aging and 14 specific age-related proteins linked to social disadvantage during both early and later life. Individuals experiencing social disadvantage had an increased risk of 66 age-related diseases, with up to 39% of these associations mediated by the 14 age-related proteins (for example, DNAJB9, F2, HSPA1A, BGN). The main enriched pathway involved the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory regulator NF-κB24 and its downstream factor interleukin-8. Our findings support the hypothesis that social disadvantage throughout the life course may accelerate aging, a biological mechanism that could explain why social stratification plays such a fundamental role in determining human health.	14/03/2025
40090318	Multi-Targeting CAR-T Cell Strategies to Overcome Immune Evasion in Lymphoid and Myeloid Malignancies	Alexandre Trubert , Fabio Toppeta , Jessica Peter, Jessica Peter , Michael Hudecek , Sophia Danhof , Thomas Däullary	Background: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has become a groundbreaking treatment for hematological malignancies, particularly lymphomas and multiple myeloma, with high remission rates in refractory and relapsed patients. However, most CAR-T therapies target a single antigen, such as CD19, which can result in immune evasion through antigen escape. This mechanism describes the downregulation or complete loss of the targeted antigen by the tumor cells, eventually leading to relapse. To address this issue, multi-targeting strategies like logic-gated CARs, adapter CARs, or combination therapies can increase the potency of CAR-T cells. These approaches aim to minimize immune evasion by targeting multiple antigens simultaneously, thereby increasing treatment durability. Additionally, advanced tools such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), or multiparametric flow cytometry are helping to identify novel tumor-specific targets and improve therapy designs. Summary: This review explores the current landscape of CAR-T cell therapies in lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, highlights ongoing clinical trials, and discusses the future of these innovative multi-targeting approaches to improve patient outcome. Key messages: Antigen escape limits CAR-T cell therapy success, but multi-targeting strategies like logic gates and adapter CARs offer solutions. Optimizing antigen selection and CAR design, along with larger clinical trials, is essential for improving patient outcomes. Personalization using advanced technologies like CRISPR screening and single-cell RNA sequencing can enhance durability and effectiveness of treatments for heavily pretreated patients.	20/03/2025
40085178	Efficacy and Safety of Phosphate-Lowering Agents for Adult Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Requiring Dialysis: A Network Meta-Analysis	Aya Mizukami , Hiroki Nishiwaki , Hiroshi Kimura , Hirotaka Saito , Hisashi Noma , Masafumi Fukagawa, Masatomo Taniguchi , Masatoshi Nishimoto, Masatoshi Nishimoto , Miho Murashima , Shunsuke Yamada , Takayuki Hamano , Takeshi Hasegawa ,	Background: It is necessary to update the evidence of each phosphate-lowering agent on dialysis patients. Methods: From the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrial.gov databases, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using oral phosphate-lowering agents on adult patients requiring maintenance dialysis were extracted. The treatment period was required for eight or more weeks, and the risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration method. The outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, gastrointestinal (GI) events, fracture, coronary artery calcium score (CACS), serum calcium, phosphate, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and bicarbonate levels. A network meta-analyses using multivariate random-effects models were performed for assessing the comparative effectiveness. The ranking of the phosphate-lowering agents was assessed using a surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Results: A total of 70 RCTs involving 15,551 participants were included. Eleven phosphate-lowering agents including calcium-based agents, sevelamer, bixalomer, lanthanum, sucroferric oxyhydroxide, ferric citrate, tenapanor, magnesium, nicotinamide, aluminum, and sucralfate were assessed. Sevelamer was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality compared with calcium-based agents [risk ratio (95% Confidence Interval {CI}): 0.59 (0.37-0.94)], and sucroferric oxyhydroxide and tenapanor were estimated to rank high in terms of lowering all-cause mortality based on the SUCRA. The risk of GI events was the highest with nicotinamide, followed by sucroferric oxyhydroxide. Compared with calcium-based agents, CACS were significantly lower among those on lanthanum and sucroferric oxyhydroxide [standardized mean difference (95% CI): -0.26 (-0.52 to -0.01) and -0.50 (-0.95 to -0.06), respectively]. Serum calcium levels were higher and serum iPTH levels were lower in patients treated with calcium-based agents. Except for sevelamer, serum bicarbonate levels for all other agents were higher compared with placebo. Conclusions: Compared with calcium-based agents, sevelamer was associated with lower all-cause mortality, and sucroferric oxyhydroxide and lanthanum were associated with slower progression of CACS. Potential benefits and harms should be considered when selecting phosphate-lowering agents (PROSPERO: CRD42022328388).	14/03/2025
40071387	PCSK9 Promotes LDLR Degradation by Preventing SNX17-Mediated LDLR Recycling	Min Liu , Mingkun Du , Xiaomin Liu # , Xiaowei Pan , Xinyu Zhu , Yan Wang, YangYang Guan, YangYang Guan # , Zetian Yang # ,	Background: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is internalized into cells mainly through LDLR (LDL receptor)-mediated endocytosis. In an acidic endosome, LDLR is released from LDL and recycles back to the cell surface, whereas LDL is left in the endosome and degraded in the lysosome. Circulating PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9) binds with LDLR and is internalized into the endosome, similar to LDL. In an acidic endosome, LDLR fails to disassociate from PCSK9, and both proteins are degraded in the lysosome. PCSK9 inhibitors are widely used for treating hypercholesterolemia. However, how PCSK9 diverts LDLR to the lysosome for degradation remains elusive. Some patients are resistant to PCSK9 inhibitors, for unknown reasons. Methods: Both in vitro and in vivo approaches were used to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. LDLR containing FH sequence variations was expressed in LDLR knockout mice and knockout HuH7 cells to evaluate their response to PCSK9 and PCSK9 inhibitors. Results: Acidic pH induces a conformational change in LDLR extracellular domain and promotes its interaction with SNX17 (sorting nexin 17) through the intracellular domain. Knocking down SNX17 abolishes LDLR recycling and causes accelerated degradation in the lysosome. PCSK9 prevents the acidic pH-induced conformational change in LDLR and blocks its interaction with SNX17. Knocking down SNX17 abolishes PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. Any FH sequence variations that disrupt LDLR recycling are unresponsive to PCSK9 or PCSK9 inhibitors, even though they can internalize LDL. Conclusions: PCSK9 promotes LDLR degradation by preventing SNX17-mediated LDLR recycling. Patients with sequence variations in FH leading to defects in LDLR recycling are resistant to PCSK9 inhibitors. Genetic diagnosis and alternative drugs independent of LDLR will be needed for treatment of these patients.	12/03/2025

40095377	Safety of Anti-osteoarthritis Medications: A Systematic Literature Review of Post-marketing Surveillance Studies	Germain Honvo, Germain Honvo , Jean-Yves Reginster , Laetitia Lengelé , Majed Alokail , Nasser Al-Daghri , Olivier Bruyère	"Background: Several meta-analyses of phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were published in 2019, reassessing the safety of most anti-osteoarthritis (OA) medications, mainly on the basis of data from full safety reports. The current systematic review (SR) intends to provide complementary insights into the safety of anti-OA medications, using evidence from post-marketing safety surveillance studies. Methods: The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO database (registration no. CRD42021227872). We followed the Cochrane methodology for SRs of interventions and comprehensively searched the Medline, CENTRAL, Scopus and TOXLINE databases from inception to November 2023, to include all post-marketing safety surveillance studies on any anti-OA medications. The outcomes of this SR were any adverse events (AEs) reported in the included studies. Results: The literature search yielded 16,990 studies, of which 59 articles were ultimately included in the review. Most studies investigated non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, 27 studies, 28 reports) and intra-articular hyaluronic acid (IAHA, 16 studies). Symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOAs) were assessed in seven studies (one of which also assessed NSAIDs), and corticosteroid injections in four studies, while opioids and ""herbal mixtures and other compounds"" each were investigated respectively in three and two studies. Most of the studies were cohort studies (n = 44), others were case reports or case series (n = 12), RCTs (n = 2 reports of the same trial), or a case-control study (n = 1). The most commonly reported AEs with NSAIDs from cohort (sample sizes varied between 129 and 22,938 patients), RCT (21,645 patients with OA), and case-control (174 cases and 926 control patients with OA) studies were gastrointestinal (GI) and/or cardiovascular (CV) AEs, with specific AEs varying with individual NSAIDs. Where comparisons between NSAIDs were made, the overall literature shows a better or similar safety profile for celecoxib (at a daily dose of 200 mg, where dosage was reported) compared with other NSAIDs in regards to GI, CV and renal events. Other anti-OA medications with most common AEs reported from cohort studies were: IAHA (injection site pain); diacerein (GI AEs and reddish urine); avocado-soybean unsaponifiables (GI AEs); non-pharmaceutical-grade glucosamine and chondroitin (allergic reactions, GI disorders); opioids (hip fracture associated with long-term tramadol use among older adults; GI and nervous system disorders with hydrocodone); corticosteroid injections (increased risk of OA progression); herbal mixtures and other compounds (GI AEs). There were case reports or case series of specific AEs with various anti-OA medications that require further investigations in well-designed cohort studies before any definitive conclusions can be reached. Conclusions: This SR confirms previous evidence on the safety of anti-OA medications from meta-analyses of phase 3 RCTs. Beyond the evidence here reported, the limitations of this research highlight the urgent need of a reporting guideline for post-marketing safety surveillance studies. Importantly, real-life safety surveillance of anti-OA medications should be strengthened with large cohort studies with control groups, and results should be disaggregated by disease populations for drugs common to several conditions."	17/03/2025
40082724	The role of the immune system in osteoarthritis: mechanisms, challenges and future directions	David Moulin, David Moulin , Francis Berenbaum , Jérémie Sellam , Jérôme Guicheux , Marie-Astrid Boutet	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease that has long been considered a simple wear-and-tear condition. Over the past decade, research has revealed that various inflammatory features of OA, such as low-grade peripheral inflammation and synovitis, contribute substantially to the pathophysiology of the disease. Technological advances in the past 5 years have revealed a large diversity of innate and adaptive immune cells in the joints, particularly in the synovium and infrapatellar fat pad. Notably, the presence of synovial lymphoid structures, circulating autoantibodies and alterations in memory T cell and B cell populations have been documented in OA. These data indicate a potential contribution of self-reactivity to the disease pathogenesis, blurring the often narrow and inaccurate line between chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The diverse immune changes associated with OA pathogenesis can vary across disease phenotypes, and a better characterization of their underlying molecular endotypes will be key to stratifying patients, designing novel therapeutic approaches and ultimately ameliorating treatment allocation. Furthermore, examining both articular and systemic alterations, including changes in the gut-joint axis and microbial dysbiosis, could open up novel avenues for OA management.	13/03/2025

However, our understanding of the splenic niche is very limited. Herein, we report that induced expression of the secreted protein Gremlin 1 in a mouse model restrains chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progression and synergizes with tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment, whereas blockade of Gremlin 1 promotes CML development. Intriguingly, the effect of Gremlin 1 is most evident in the spleen but not in the bone marrow. Gremlin 1 induces apoptosis of leukemic stem cells via antagonizing the BMP pathway. Single-cell RNA sequencing and experimental validation together show that Gremlin 1 marks a unique stromal cell population in the spleens of both mice and humans. Genetic ablation of Gremlin 1+ cells leads to accelerated CML progression. Collectively, Gremlin 1 and Gremlin 1+ cells are key defensive niche components in the spleen that limit CML progression, revealing an unprecedented mechanism for the body to fight off leukemia.	17/03/2025

40088318	Stress hyperglycemia ratio and 30-day mortality among critically ill patients with acute heart failure: analysis of the MIMIC-IV database	Hengzhi Zhang # , Peipei Huang, Tianshi Li # , Xiaodong You, Xiaodong You # , Xufeng Chen , Yi Zhu , Zhongman Zhang ,	Background: The association between the stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) and short-term prognosis of acute heart failure (AHF), particularly among those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), has not been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the association between the SHR and adverse outcomes among critically ill patients with AHF and provide a reference for glycemic management range in these patients. Methods: We extracted the clinical data of patients from the MIMIC-IV (v3.0) database. The association between the SHR and short-term prognosis was analyzed using the Kaplan‒Meier survival curve, Cox regression, and subgroup analysis. Important features were identified utilizing machine learning methods. Furthermore, the association between the dynamic SHR level and mortality was explored using restricted cubic splines and Cox regression. Results: A total of 994 patients were included. Patients with the highest SHR (Quartile 4) had a higher risk of 30-day mortality (HR = 2.14; 95% CI = 1.32-3.45; P = 0.002) and in-hospital mortality (HR = 2.22; 95% CI = 1.27-3.88; P = 0.005) than those in Quartile 2 (as reference). The results of machine learning methods revealed the SHR was an important predictor for 30-day mortality of patients with critical AHF. Restricted cubic splines indicated a J-shaped association between the dynamic SHR level and mortality, and the cut-off values were 0.84 and 1.07. Conclusion: The SHR was significantly associated with 30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality among patients with critical AHF. The SHR may be a useful indicator for the glycemic management of patients with AHF in the ICU.	15/03/2025
40082617	Sympathetic and parasympathetic subtypes of body-first Lewy body disease observed in postmortem tissue from prediagnostic individuals	Anushree Krishnamurthy # , Casper Skjærbæk , Jacob Horsager , Jacob W Vogel , Johannes Attems , Jon B Toledo , Karoline Knudsen , Katrine B Andersen, Katrine B Andersen # , Mie Kristine Just , Nathalie Van Den Berge , Per Borghammer, Shigeo Murayama , Tuomo Polvikoski , Yuko Saito ,	Recent studies suggest the existence of brain-first and body-first subtypes within the Lewy body disorder (LBD) spectrum, including Parkinson's disease. These studies primarily focused on α-synuclein propagation through the parasympathetic vagal and olfactory bulb routes, leaving the possibility of a sympathetic nervous system spreading route unexplored. In the present study, we analyzed two postmortem datasets, which included 173 and 129 cases positive for Lewy pathology. We observed a clear distinction between brain-first and body-first subtypes in early prediagnostic cases with mild Lewy pathology. Brain-first cases displayed minimal peripheral organ pathology in prediagnostic phases, contrasting with marked autonomic involvement in prediagnostic body-first cases. Utilizing the SuStaIn machine learning algorithm, we identified two distinct body-first subtypes, one with vagal predominance and another with sympathetic predominance, in equal proportions. Our study supports the existence of three prediagnostic LBD subtypes and highlights the sympathetic nervous system alongside the parasympathetic system in LBD onset and progression.	13/03/2025
40095219	Waldenström Macroglobulinemia: 2025 Update on Diagnosis, Risk Stratification, and Management	Morie A Gertz, Morie A Gertz.	Disease overview: Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal protein. Clinical features include anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and rarely hyperviscosity. Diagnosis: The presence of IgM monoclonal protein associated with ≥ 10% clonal lymphoplasmacytic cells in bone marrow confirms the diagnosis. The L265P mutation in MYD88 is detectable in more than 90% of patients and is found in most IgM MGUS patients. MYD88 is not required for the diagnosis. Risk stratification: Age, albumin, hemoglobin level, platelet count, β2 microglobulin, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and monoclonal IgM concentrations are characteristics that are predictive of outcomes. Risk-adapted therapy: Not all patients who fulfill WM criteria require therapy; these patients can be observed until symptoms develop. Rituximab-monotherapy is inferior to combination regimens. Recommended first-line therapy can be chemoimmunotherapy or a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The preferred Mayo Clinic induction is either rituximab and bendamustine (without rituximab maintenance) or zanubrutinib. Management of refractory disease: Bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, thalidomide, everolimus, pirtobrutinib, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, bendamustine, and venetoclax have all been shown to have activity in relapsed WM. Given WM's natural history, the reduction of therapy toxicity is an important part of treatment selection. Most patients succumb to causes unrelated to macroglobulinemia.	17/03/2025

Current models propose that fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cells transform into serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) precursor lesions and subsequently HGSOC. Here we report that an epigenetically altered mesenchymal stem cell niche, termed high risk MSC (hrMSC), exists prior to STIC lesion formation. hrMSCs are enriched in STIC stroma and contribute to a stromal 'field effect' extending beyond the borders of STIC lesion. hrMSCs promote DNA damage in FTE cells while also fostering FTE cell survival. hrMSCs induce malignant transformation of FTE resulting in metastatic cancer in vivo, indicating hrMSCs promote cancer initiation. hrMSCs are significantly enriched in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and increase with age. Combined, these findings indicate that hrMSCs can incite ovarian cancer initiation and have important implications for ovarian cancer detection and prevention.	14/03/2025

While familial ALS is caused by mutations in many genes of diverse functions, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of ALS, especially in sporadic ALS (sALS), are largely unknown. Notably, about half of the cases with sALS showed defects in mitochondrial respiratory complex IV (CIV). To determine the causal role of this defect in ALS, we used transcription activator-like effector-based mitochondrial genome editing to introduce mutations in CIV subunits in rat neurons. Our results demonstrate that neuronal CIV deficiency is sufficient to cause a number of ALS-like phenotypes, including cytosolic TAR DNA-binding protein 43 redistribution, selective motor neuron loss and paralysis. These results highlight CIV deficiency as a potential cause of sALS and shed light on the specific vulnerability of motor neurons, marking an important advance in understanding and therapeutic development of sALS.	11/03/2025

Previous studies suggest that older humans are more resistant to H5N1 infections due to childhood imprinting with other group 1 viruses (H1N1 and H2N2); however, the immunological basis for this is incompletely understood. Here we measured H5N1 antibody responses in sera from 157 individuals born between 1927 and 2016. We show that antibody titers to historical and recent H5N1 strains are highest in older individuals and correlate more strongly with birth year than with age, consistent with immune imprinting. Young children, who were likely not yet exposed to seasonal influenza viruses, had low levels of H5-specific antibodies. We also measured H5N1 antibody responses in sera from 100 individuals before and after receiving an A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 vaccine. We found that both younger and older humans produced H5-reactive antibodies to the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine strain and to a contemporary clade 2.3.4.4b strain, with higher seroconversion rates in young children who had lower levels of antibodies before vaccination. These studies suggest that younger individuals might benefit more from vaccination than older individuals in the event of an H5N1 pandemic.	13/03/2025
40081325	Chemotherapy-Based Combination Regimens for Advanced EGFR-Mutant NSCLC After EGFR-TKI Failure: A Network Meta-Analysis	Jun Liao , Lan-Lan Pang, Lan-Lan Pang , Li Zhang , Meng-Di Li , Wei-Tao Zhuang , Wen-Feng Fang , Ya-Xiong Zhang, Zi-Hong Chen ,	"Background: Traditional chemotherapy provides restricted benefits for advanced EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after failure of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), necessitating the combined treatment. However, it remains controversial which is the optimal regimen. Methods: Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing various platinum-based chemotherapy (Chemo) regimens in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who experienced disease progression on EGFR-TKIs were included. A Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis was performed. Progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed using the logarithm of hazard ratio (HR) and its standard error, whereas objective response rate (ORR) and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were analyzed using odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals. Results: A total of 9 RCTs involving 2,534 patients with EGFR-TKI resistance, published between 2022 and 2024, were included in the meta-analysis. The analyzed regimens were summarized into 5 arms: platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (""Chemo""); immunotherapy + chemotherapy (""Chemo_IO""); bevacizumab + chemotherapy (""Chemo_Bev""), immunotherapy combined with bevacizumab (or bispecific antibody against PD-1/PD-L1 and VEGF) + chemotherapy (""Chemo_anti-PD-1/PD-L1_anti-VEGF""), and amivantamab + chemotherapy (""Chemo_Ami""). Compared with ""Chemo,"" both ""Chemo_Ami"" and ""Chemo_anti-PD-1/PD-L1_anti-VEGF"" significantly prolonged PFS (HR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.32-0.71] and HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.41-0.62], respectively) and improved ORR (OR, 3.13 [95% CI, 1.64-5.96] and OR, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.51-3.11], respectively). ""Chemo_Bev"" also significantly reduced the risk of progression (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.45-0.98]). In contrast, ""Chemo_IO"" failed to improve ORR (OR, 1.25 [95% CI, 0.89-1.81]) and provided a modest PFS benefit (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.64-0.95) compared with ""Chemo."" Furthermore, compared with ""Chemo_IO,"" both ""Chemo_Ami"" and ""Chemo_anti-PD-1/PD-L1_anti-VEGF"" significantly prolonged PFS (HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.39-0.95] and HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.52-0.81], respectively) and improved ORR (OR, 2.51 [95% CI, 1.17-5.14] and OR, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.13-2.60], respectively). No statistically significant difference in PFS was observed among ""Chemo_Ami,"" ""Chemo_anti-PD-1/PD-L1_anti-VEGF,"" and ""Chemo_Bev."" Additionally, ""Chemo_Ami"" was associated with a significantly higher incidence of grade 3-5 TRAEs (OR, 3.71 [95% CI, 1.08-12.7]) compared with ""Chemo,"" whereas no significant differences in TRAEs were observed among the other regimens. Conclusions: Antiangiogenic agents may create a therapeutic window for immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC after progression on prior EGFR-TKI treatment. Based on their superior efficacy, ""Chemo_anti-PD-1/PD-L1_anti-VEGF"" and ""Chemo_Ami"" are recommended as preferred treatment options for patients who experienced disease progression on EGFR-TKIs. Our study highlights and updated therapeutic approach for advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC."	20/03/2025
40082670	A nuclear pore-anchored condensate enables germ granule organization and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance	Boyuan Deng # , Gang Wan, Guanzheng Luo , Guorun Tang , Pu Lu, Pu Lu # , Scott Kennedy , Xinru Li , Xufang Niu , Yanhong Qiu , Yonglin Liang , Yuntao Liang , Zhongping Yuan ,	Biomolecular condensates, such as stress and germ granules, often contain subcompartments. For instance, the Caenorhabditis elegans germ granule, which localizes near the outer nuclear membrane of germ cell nuclei, is composed of at least four ordered compartments, each housing distinct sets of proteins and RNAs. How these compartments form and why they are spatially ordered remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the conserved DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX-19 defines another compartment of the larger C. elegans germ granule, which we term the D compartment. The D compartment exhibits properties of a liquid condensate and forms between the outer nuclear pore filament and other compartments of the germ granule. Two nuclear pore proteins, NPP-14 and GLEL-1, are required for its formation, suggesting that the D compartment localizes adjacent to the outer nuclear membrane through interactions with the nuclear pore. The loss of DDX-19, NPP-14 or GLEL-1 leads to functional defects, including aberrant formation of the other four germ granule compartments, a loss of germline immortality and dysregulation of small RNA-based transgenerational epigenetic inheritance programs. Hence, we propose that a function of the D compartment is to anchor larger germ granules to nuclear pores, enabling germ granule compartmentalization and promoting transgenerational RNA surveillance.	13/03/2025
40085751	A deep learning-based clinical-radiomics model predicting the treatment response of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-based conversion therapy in potentially convertible hepatocelluar carcinoma patients: a tumour marker prognostic study	Kai Mao, Weidong Wang , Yongcong Yan , Zhiyu Xiao , Zifeng Ma , Zijian Lin, Zijian Lin ,	Background: The majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) miss the opportunity of radical resection, making ICIs-based conversion therapy a primary option. However, challenges persist in predicting response and identifying the optimal patient subset. The objective is to develop a CT-based clinical-radiomics model to predict durable clinical benefit (DCB) of ICIs-based treatment in potentially convertible HCC patients. Methods: The radiomics features were extracted by pyradiomics in training set, and machine learning models was generated based on the selected radiomics features. Deep learning models were created using two different protocols. Integrated models were constructed by incorporating radiomics scores, deep learning scores, and clinical variables selected through multivariate analysis. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between integrated model scores and clinical outcomes related to conversion therapy in the entire cohort. Finally, radiogenomic analysis was conducted on bulk RNA and DNA sequencing data. Results: The top-performing integrated model demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95%CI: 0.94 ~ 0.99) in the training set and 0.88 (95%CI: 0.77 ~ 0.99) in the test set, effectively stratifying survival risk across the entire cohort and revealing significant disparity in overall survival (OS), as evidenced by Kaplan-Meier survival curves (p<0.0001). Moreover, integrated model scores exhibited associations with sequential resection among patients who achieved DCB and pathological complete response (pCR) among those who underwent sequential resection procedures. Notably, higher radiomics model was correlated with MHC I expression, angiogenesis-related processes, CD8 T cell-related gene sets, as well as a higher frequency of TP53 mutations along with increased levels of mutation burden and neoantigen. Conclusion: The deep learning-based clinical-radiomics model exhibited satisfactory predictive capability in forecasting the DCB derived from ICIs-based conversion therapy in potentially convertible HCC, and was associated with a diverse range of immune-related mechanisms.	14/03/2025

40087473	p-Coumaric acid alleviates neuronal damage in ischemic stroke mice by promoting BACH1 nuclear export and degradation	Hai-Jun Yin , Hua Yang, Meng-Lu Song, Meng-Lu Song , Yi Li , Yun-Yun Sun ,	Oxidative damage induced by glutamate triggers neuronal death in cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury. BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) is a major link between the cellular heme level, the redox state and the transcriptional response. p-Coumaric acid (p-CA) is a natural antioxidant that has been shown to ameliorate ischemic/reperfusion injury. In this study, we investigated whether and how p-CA regulated BACH1 in ischemic/reperfusion injury from the perspective of BACH1 subcellular localization and function. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established in male mice. MCAO mice were treated with p-CA (50, 100 mg/kg, ip) twice 5 min after MCAO and 5 h after reperfusion operation, respectively. We showed that p-CA treatment exerted dramatic neuroprotective effects, which were associated with the inhibition of BACH1. In HT22 cells, treatment with p-CA (20 μM) ameliorated OGD/R or glutamate-induced oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction through decreasing the protein level of BACH1, the beneficial effect of p-CA was blocked by BACH1 overexpression. We demonstrated that BACH1 level was markedly elevated in the nucleus of HT22 cells under glutamate stimulation, and transcriptionally regulated NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) expression, thus mediating ROS outbreak. p-CA treatment activated the activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 (ACK1)/protein kinase B (AKT) cascade to facilitate the phosphorylation of BACH1, augmented its interaction with chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1), thereby leading to the export of BACH1 from the nucleus and degradation mediated by heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase-1 (HOIL-1). In accord with this, administration of ACK1 inhibitor AIM-100 (20 mg/kg, ip) 5 min after MCAO significantly attenuated the neuroprotective effects of p-CA in MCAO mice. We concluded that ACK1/AKT/BACH1 axis may serve as a promising therapeutic approach for the management of ischemic stroke, thereby broadening the clinical utility of p-CA.Keywords: ischemic/reperfusion injury; p-Coumaric acid; BACH1; NOX4; ACK1/AKT; AIM-100.	14/03/2025
40099430	Treatment for Dyskinesia in Parkinson's Disease: A Network Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials	Dongning Su , Junjiao Zhang , Rui Yan, Rui Yan , Tao Feng, Xiaoqing Zheng , Yixuan Yin , Yusha Cui , Zhirong Wan ,	Background: Dyskinesia is a motor complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) posing therapeutic challenges. The optimal therapy for dyskinesia in PD has not been identified due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation of treatments. Objective: The aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of interventions for alleviating levodopa-induced dyskinesia in PD. Methods: We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) by systematically searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EudraCT databases up to April 1, 2024. The primary efficacy outcome was the change in scores on dyskinesia rating scales from baseline. Results: The study included 85 randomized controlled trials (RCT) involving 13,826 PD patients, comprising 39 interventions. Nine treatments were significantly more effective in reducing scores on dyskinesia rating scales than control (placebo, sham surgery, sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, or best medical treatment). Globus pallidus interna deep brain stimulation (GPi-DBS) had the highest probability to be the most effective (standardized mean difference, 95% credible interval: -1.27, -1.65 to -0.88; surface under the cumulative ranking curve [SUCRA]: 97.4%), followed by levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion (SUCRA = 89.7%), subthalamic nucleus (STN)-DBS (SUCRA = 89%), immediate-release (IR) amantadine (SUCRA = 86.5%), pallidotomy (SUCRA = 84.9%), ADS-5102 (SUCRA = 82.9%), clozapine (SUCRA = 77.2%), OS320 (SUCRA = 64.8%), and AFQ056 (SUCRA = 54.5%). GPi-DBS was superior to STN-DBS, and pallidotomy ranked higher than subthalamotomy. ADS-5102 and OS320 had higher adverse event (AE) rates compared to control, whereas AFQ056 and ADS-5102 were linked to more serious AEs. Conclusions: This RCT-based NMA identifies and ranks nine efficacious interventions for dyskinesia in PD. GPi-DBS may be the most effective therapy for treating dyskinesia, with IR amantadine ranking highest among oral medications. Novel anti-dyskinetic medications are associated with less-favorable tolerance profiles. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.	18/03/2025
40087542	NERD-dependent m6A modification of the nascent FLC transcript regulates flowering time in Arabidopsis	Hao Yu, Jinqi Ma , Songyao Zhang , Yanlin Shao, Yanlin Shao , Yifeng Xu ,	N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification on messenger RNA. Although recent studies have shown m6A effects on determining the fate of mRNA through modulating various aspects of plant mRNA metabolism, whether and how m6A affects gene transcription in plants remains elusive. Here we show that NEEDED FOR RDR2-INDEPENDENT DNA METHYLATION (NERD), a plant-specific protein, is an essential component of the m6A methyltransferase complex required for regulating the transcription of a central floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) in Arabidopsis. NERD interacts with and stabilizes the two core methyltransferases, mRNA adenosine methylases A and B, to promote m6A modification of nascent RNA, conferring an overall negative effect on gene transcription. At the FLC locus, NERD-mediated m6A modification on the nascent transcript negatively affects H3K36me3 deposition and FLC transcription through NERD interaction with the H3K36me3 methyltransferase SET DOMAIN GROUP 8. Collectively, our findings reveal that NERD mediates the crosstalk between epitranscriptomic and epigenetic regulation of FLC to modulate flowering in Arabidopsis.	14/03/2025
40090879	A Comprehensive Review of Interstitial Lung Abnormalities	John A Mackintosh, Yuben Moodley, Yuben Moodley ,	Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) represent radiological entities that comprise changes compatible with an interstitial process, occurring in individuals not suspected to have interstitial lung disease (ILD). The prevalence of ILAs ranges from 2.5% to 16.7% in lung cancer screening and population-based cohorts. ILAs have consistently been associated with mortality. Risk factors include older age, smoking, and genetic polymorphisms such as MUC5B. Progression of ILAs occurs in 20%-76% of cases over 2-6 years of follow-up. The clinical approach to ILAs involves risk stratification based on radiological features, extent of involvement, and associated clinical and physiological findings. ILAs pose a significant challenge in distinguishing inconsequential radiological findings from early ILD. This review summarises the current understanding of ILAs, including prevalence, risk factors, progression, associated biomarkers, and clinical management strategies.	16/03/2025
40099394	Ophiopogonin D from Ophiopogon japonicas-induced USP25 Activity to Reduce Ferroptosis of Macrophage in Acute Lung Injury by the Inhibition of Bound Rac1 and Nox1 Complex	Haitang Xie , Min Zhao, Wenhui Wang , Yingjing Gui , Yinping Shui , Zhichen Pu, Zhichen Pu ,	Acute lung injury (ALI) can lead to severe respiratory system damage, characterized by extensive inflammation and lung tissue injury. Ophiopogonin D (OD), from Ophiopogon japonicus, has pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant, hypoglycemic, anti-aging, and immune regulation properties. This study attempts to identify the protective mechanism of OD against ALI by the inhibition of ferroptosis of macrophages. The tissue-specific expression of USP25 in patients with COVID-19 was evaluated using single-cell data from the China National GeneBank and the GSE147507 dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). C57BL/6 mice, Murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) or RAW264.7 cells were induced by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). OD prevented ALI, and reduced inflammation levels and oxidative stress in mice models. OD significantly decreased the number of monocyte/macrophages (CD11b [Formula: see text]Ly6G-cells) in the peritoneal cavity after ALI induction. OD-mitigated inflammation and oxidative stress of macrophages in the ALI model. OD-reduced ferroptosis of macrophages in a model of ALI through the inhibition of ROS-induced mitochondrial damage. USP25 is significantly expressed in macrophages in patients with COVID-19 using single-cell analysis. OD-suppressed Rac1/NOX1-derived ROS to reduce the mitochondrial damage of macrophages in a model of ALI by the induction of USP25 activity. OD-identified USP25 at 907-VAL and 975-ARG in an ALI model to suppress USP25 Ubiquitination. OD from Ophiopogon japonicus induces USP25 activity to reduce ferroptosis of macrophages in ALI by binding the Rac1 and Nox1 complex. Therefore, it can be concluded that OD may be a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of ALI.	20/03/2025
40095047	Unveiling cardiovascular and respiratory toxicities with monoclonal antibodies in multiple myeloma: disproportionality analysis from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System	Edoardo Spina, Giulia Russo , Giuseppe Andò , Giuseppe Cicala , Maria Antonietta Barbieri, Maria Antonietta Barbieri , Mariacarmela Santarpia , Nicola Silvestris , Tindara Franchina ,	Introduction: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revolutionized the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), demonstrating remarkable effectiveness, despite potential adverse events (AEs). This study aims to identify unexpected signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) for cardiovascular (CV) and respiratory AEs associated with mAbs in MM treatment. Methods: From January 2015 to December 2023, reports involving suspected drugs (daratumumab, elotuzumab, elranatamab, isatuximab, belantamab mafodotin, teclistamab, and talquetamab) were analyzed in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Descriptive analysis was followed by disproportionality analyses first comparing mAbs to all other drugs (reference group, RG1), and subsequently conducting a sensitivity analysis against other MM drugs (RG2). Results: Out of 13,496,241 reports, 31,052 (0.2%) were associated with MM, with 6574 (0.1%) linked to CV and respiratory adverse events, primarily involving older population (n = 3441; 52.3%) and male (n = 3338; 50.8%) patients. Disproportionality analyses identified unexpected SDRs for daratumumab, including cardiac failure (n = 322; RG1: ROR = 4.74, CI 95% = 4.24-5.29; RG2: ROR = 4.42, 95% CI = 3.91-4.99), embolic and thrombotic event, such as pulmonary embolism (162; RG1: 2.44, 2.09-2.85), deep vein thrombosis (126; RG1: 2.95, 2.47-3.52), and respiratory failure (192; RG1: 4.06, 3.52-4.68; RG2: 4.2, 3.59-4.91). Isatuximab was linked to cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation (46; RG1: 2.54, 1.9-3.4; RG2: 1.35, 1.01-1.81), embolic and thrombotic event, including deep vein thrombosis (26; RG1: 2.93, 1.99-4.3) and pulmonary embolism (89; RG1: 6.56, 5.32-8.1; RG2: 2.93, 2.37-3.63). Elotuzumab showed also SDRs for atrial fibrillation (56; RG1: 3.68, 2.82-4.79; RG2: 1.96, 1.5-2.56) and deep vein thrombosis (41; RG1: 5.49, 4.03-7.47). Conclusion: Unexpected CV and respiratory AEs with clinical relevance not previously reported in literature have been identified underlining the importance of pharmacovigilance.	17/03/2025
16504011	A prospective study of hearing changes after beginning zidovudine or didanosine in HIV-1 treatment-naïve people	Ann C Collier, Christina M Marra, David W Lockhart, Jeffrey T Schouten, Jeffrey T Schouten , Thomas S Rees,	Background: While hearing loss in HIV-infected people after beginning nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) has been reported, there have been no prospective studies that measured hearing changes longitudinally in treatment-naïve HIV-infected subjects following initiation of regimens containing NRTIs. The goal of this study was to conduct a prospective assessment of the contribution of zidovudine (ZDV) and didanosine (ddI) to hearing loss. Methods/design: A prospective observational pilot study to determine whether ZDV or ddI, alone or in combination, are associated with sensorineural hearing loss in HIV-infected persons. Changes in hearing levels at all frequencies and in low and high frequency pure tone averages were measured at baseline, 16, and 32 weeks after initiating antiretroviral therapy. Discussion: Treatment with ZDV and ddI did not result in loss of hearing, even after taking into account noise exposure, immune status and age. The results of this prospective pilot study do not support the notion that treatment with nucleoside antiretrovirals damages hearing.	20/02/2006
40097356	Current status of generalized pustular psoriasis: Findings from a multicenter hospital-based survey of 127 Chinese patients	Aijun Chen , Bin Peng , Bin Yang , Chaoyang Miao , Chen Yu , Chunlei Zhang , Gang Wang , Haimeng Wang, Haimeng Wang , Hong Fang , Hongzhong Jin, Jiaming Xu , Jie Liu , Jinzhu Guo , Minkuo Zhang , Ping Wang , Qianjin Lu , Qing Sun , Qingjie Hu , Qingmiao Sun , Sheng Wang , Siyu Hao , Songmei Geng , Xian Jiang , Xiaoling Yu , Xiaona Li , Xueqin Chen , Yan Lu , Yuzhen Li , Zhiqiang Song , Zhonglan Su , Zigang Xu ,	Background: Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), a rare and recurrent autoinflammatory disease, imposes a substantial burden on patients and society. Awareness of GPP in China remains limited. Methods: This cross-sectional survey, conducted between September 2021 and May 2023 across 14 hospitals in China, included GPP patients of all ages and disease phases. Data collected encompassed demographics, clinical characteristics, economic impact, disease severity, quality of life, and treatment-related complications. Risk factors for GPP recurrence were analyzed. Results: Among 127 patients (female/male ratio = 1.35:1), the mean age of disease onset was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 11-44 years); 29.2% had experienced GPP for more than 10 years. Recurrence occurred in 75.6% of patients, and nearly half reported no identifiable triggers. Younger age at disease onset (P = 0.021) and transitioning to plaque psoriasis (P = 0.022) were associated with higher recurrence rates. The median diagnostic delay was 8 months (IQR: 2-41), and 32.3% of patients reported misdiagnoses. Comorbidities were present in 53.5% of patients, whereas 51.1% experienced systemic complications during treatment. Depression and anxiety affected 84.5% and 95.6% of patients, respectively. During GPP flares, the median Dermatology Life Quality Index score was 19.0 (IQR: 13.0-23.5). This score showed significant differences between patients with and without systemic symptoms; it demonstrated correlations with both depression and anxiety scores. Treatment costs caused financial hardship in 55.9% of patients, underscoring the burden associated with GPP. Conclusions: The substantial disease and economic burdens among Chinese GPP patients warrant increased attention. Patients with early onset disease and those transitioning to plaque psoriasis require targeted interventions to mitigate the high recurrence risk.	17/03/2025
40087248	Update on Neuroprotection after Traumatic Brain Injury	Aaron M Cook, Aaron M Cook , Blake Robbins, Morgan Michas ,	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A focus on neuroprotective agents to prevent the secondary injury cascade that follows moderate-to-severe TBI has informed the field greatly but has not yielded any viable therapeutic options to date. New strategies and pharmacotherapy options for neuroprotection continue to be evaluated, including tranexamic acid, progesterone, cerebrolysin, cyclosporin A, citicholine, memantine, and lactate. Biomarkers of injury that can aid in diagnosis and prognosis have also been elucidated and are incrementally being used in clinical practice. The spectrum of TBI severity has also gained increasing attention as it relates to mild TBI or concussion, blast injury, and subacute or chronic subdural hematomas. In this review, we review the pathophysiology, recent clinical trials, and future directions for acute TBI.	14/03/2025
40097336	Evidence-Based Recommendations for Managing Atopic Dermatitis in Pediatric Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis From the Pediatric Dermatology Special Interest Group of IADVL	Bhumesh Kumar Katakam , Jigna Padhiyar , Krina Bharat Patel , Liza Mohapatra , Maitreyee Panda , Members of SIG Pediatric Dermatology and IADVL Academy, Nibedita Patro , Rahul Mahajan, Rahul Mahajan , Rashmi Sarkar , Rita Vora , Shazia Shah , Sudarshan P Gaurkar , Thiruveedhula Haritha , Vinutha Rangappa ;	Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory skin disease in the pediatric age group, affecting 15%-20% of children globally. Initial treatment modes include hydration, occlusive topical medicines, antimicrobial treatment, phototherapy, and systemic immune suppressants in the case of severe to moderate refractory AD. However, there is a lack of head-to-head studies on the choice of topical and systemic therapies for moderate to severe AD in the pediatric age group. Objective: This systematic review aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of topical and systemic treatments for moderate-to-severe AD in the pediatric age group. Method: A systematic review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A search of articles was done from PubMed and Google Scholar from 1975 to 2023. Results: We found a total of 1114 possible clinical trials. Of these, 68 articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Thirty-four articles discussed topical therapies, which included corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and emollients, and 34 articles were about systemic therapies, consisting of cyclosporine, dupilumab, upadacitinib, thymopentin, omalizumab, antihistamines, probiotics, and others. Out of 68 studies, 41 were randomized controlled trials. Conclusion: Based on the study results, we conclude that topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors are effective and safe in mild to moderate pediatric AD. It was also demonstrated that while systemic monotherapy with dupilumab (in age groups younger than 6 months) and JAK inhibitors (like abrocitinib and upadacitinib in those younger than 12 years) is highly effective in rapidly reducing severity scores, their high cost and limited availability restrict their use in countries like India. In such settings, cyclosporine (and sometimes oral prednisolone in tapering doses over 2 weeks) is still recommended as a first-line therapy in severe AD while planning for steroid-sparing agents.	17/03/2025
40087828	Asciminib: the tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a unique mechanism of action	Akriti G Jain, Akriti G Jain , Jorge E Cortes	Introduction: Management of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) was revolutionized with the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Imatinib (first generation), dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib (second generation) and ponatinib (third generation) are the five approved TKIs that inhibit BCR::ABL1 by binding to the ATP binding site of ABL1. About half of the resistance to TKIs develops through acquisition of mutations in the ATP binding site, including T315I. Hence, a novel TKI with a distinct mechanism of action, that inhibits bcr-abl1 by specifically targeting the ABL1 myristoyl pocket (STAMP inhibitor) was developed. Areas covered: Asciminib was first approved for treatment of CML-CP in the third line setting or beyond and in patients with T315I mutation in October, 2021. More recently, in October, 2024, asciminib was approved for newly diagnosed CML-CP based on ASC4FIRST data showing MMR rate of 67.7% in the asciminib arm compared to 49% in the investigator choice TKI arm (p < 0.001) at 48 weeks. In this review we detail the mechanism of action, preclinical data, clinical data, safety and tolerability of asciminib. Expert opinion: Due to its mechanism of action, asciminib has fewer off target effects, resulting in an improved safety and tolerability profile.	14/03/2025
40049228	Sensing ceramides by CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 to aggravate atherosclerosis	Changtao Jiang , Enmin Xie , HaoMing He , Hui Lin # , Jiaai Tan , Jiale Wang # , Jingang Zheng , Jingyu Rui # , Jinpeng Sun , Meihong Li , Qiang Chen , Rongbo Dai , Rui Fan , Rui Gu , Shenming Huang # , Shirong Zhu , Siting Zhang, Siting Zhang # , Tengwei Wang # , Tianfeng Ma , Wei Kong, Yanxiang Gao , Yi Fu , Yiting Jia , Zeyu Cai # , Zhigang Dong , Zhiqing Li ,	Recent evidence shows elevated circulating long-chain ceramide levels predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) independently of cholesterol1,2. Although targeting ceramide signaling may provide therapeutic benefits beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, the underlying mechanism by which circulating ceramides aggravate ASCVD remains elusive. We examined whether circulating long-chain ceramides activate membrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to exacerbate atherosclerosis. We performed a systematic screen combining G protein signaling quantification, bioinformatic analysis of GPCRs expression, and functional examination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the results suggested CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 are potential endogenous receptors of C16:0 ceramide-evoked inflammasome activation in both endothelial cells and macrophages. We found that inhibiting CYSLTR2/P2RY6 genetically or pharmacologically alleviated ceramide-induced atherosclerosis aggravation. Additionally, increased ceramide levels correlated with the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Notably, CYSLTR2/P2RY6 deficiency mitigated chronic kidney disease (CKD)-aggravated atherosclerosis in mice, without affecting cholesterol or ceramide levels. Structural analysis of the ceramide-CYSLTR2-Gq complexes revealed that both C16:0 and C20:0 ceramides bind within an inclined channel-like ligand binding pocket on CYSLTR2. We further revealed an unconventional mechanism underlying ceramides-induced CYSLTR2 activation and CYSLTR2-Gq interface. Overall, our study provided structural and molecular mechanisms that long-chain ceramides initiate transmembrane Gq and inflammasome signaling through directly binding to CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 receptors, and blocking these signaling may provide new therapeutic potential to treat atherosclerosis-related diseases.	06/03/2025
40096693	Pharmacologic Treatment of Acute Attacks of Episodic Migraine: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis for the American College of Physicians	Andrea Chapman , Andreea Dobrescu , Arianna Gadinger , Camilla Neubauer , Claus Nowak , Emma Persad , Gerald Gartlehner, Gerald Gartlehner , Gernot Wagner , Irma Klerings , Johanna Feyertag , Kylie Thaler	Background: Migraine is common, affecting 15% of Americans. Purpose: To compare benefits and harms of pharmacologic treatments for acute attacks of episodic migraine in adults and assess cost-effectiveness. Data sources: Three electronic databases searched to October 2024, gray literature, and reference lists. Study selection: Two investigators independently selected English-language randomized trials. Data extraction: Single reviewer data extraction with second review. Dual independent risk of bias and certainty of evidence (COE) assessment. Data synthesis: Twenty-one head-to-head and 165 placebo-controlled trials were included in meta-analyses and network meta-analyses. Triptans were more effective than acetaminophen (low COE) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (high COE) for pain outcomes at 2 hours and pain freedom up to 48 hours. Triptan and acetaminophen combinations were more effective than acetaminophen alone (moderate COE) for pain outcomes at 2 hours and pain freedom up to 48 hours but not more than triptans alone (low COE). Triptan and NSAID combinations were more effective for pain outcomes at 2 hours and pain freedom up to 48 hours compared with acetaminophen (low COE), gepants (low COE), NSAIDs (high COE), and triptan monotherapy (moderate COE). Triptan regimens, however, often had a higher risk for adverse events. One study found triptans more cost-effective than ditans and gepants. Limitations: Harms assessment was limited to randomized trials. Many comparisons lacked sufficient evidence to draw conclusions. Conclusion: Triptans and combinations of triptans were more effective than NSAID and acetaminophen alone. Primary funding source: American College of Physicians.

40088079	Patients with Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (MCT8 Deficiency) Display Symptoms of Parkinsonism in Childhood and Respond to Levodopa/Carbidopa Treatment	Alessandro Prigione , Andrea Dell'Orco , Angela L Hewitt , Angela M Kaindl , Anna Tietze , Annika Zink , Catharina Lange , Christian Furth , Christiane Grolik , Christina Reinauer , Heiko Krude , Knut Brockmann , Marie-Thérèse Henke , Markus Schuelke, Martin Bauer , Monika Wahle , Nina-Maria Wilpert, Nina-Maria Wilpert , Roser Pons , Sabine Jung-Klawitter , Stephan Menz , Stine Christ , Thomas Opladen ,	Background: Patients with mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8, SLC16A2) suffer from X-linked recessive Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), which is characterized by developmental delay and a severe movement disorder. Current trials using thyroid hormone derivatives to overcome the transporter defect have failed to achieve patient-oriented therapeutic goals. Objectives: Our aim was to define the type of movement disorder in AHDS in an observational cohort study and to investigate the causative role of the dopaminergic system. Methods: We present longitudinal clinical data from the DEEPTYPE registry of 11 patients with video documentation, standardized phenotyping, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, neuroimaging data, and the treatment response to levodopa/carbidopa supplementation. Results: Children presented with signs of childhood parkinsonism, including hypokinesia, hypomimia, inability to sit or stand, rigidity, dystonia, and autonomic dysfunction. CSF homovanillic acid concentrations were decreased (n = 12), suggesting an isolated dopamine pathway impairment. Seven out of 8 patients responded favorably to l-dopa/carbidopa supplementation and we did not observe any adverse drug reactions. Conclusions: AHDS is associated with childhood parkinsonism, which is linked with biochemical abnormalities of dopamine metabolism. It can be treated with l-dopa/carbidopa supplementation. However, further research is needed to elucidate the exact effect of MCT8 deficiency on dopamine metabolism. © 2025 The Author(s).

40084742	Thrombospondin-1 binds to integrin β3 to inhibit vascular calcification through suppression of NF-κB pathway	An Chen , Fang Liu, Fang Liu # , Jianyun Yan, Jing-Song Ou , Li Li # , Lihe Lu , Liyun Feng , Mingxi Li , Qingchun Liang # , Yining Li , Yuan Gong , Yuanzhi Ye , Zirong Lan ,	Vascular calcification is an important risk factor related to all-cause mortality of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins have been demonstrated to regulate vascular calcification. ECM protein thrombospondin 1 (THBS1/TSP-1) plays a critical role in the regulation of vascular diseases. However, whether THBS1 is involved in vascular calcification in CKD patients remains unclear. In this study, RNA sequencing datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database GSE146638 showed that THBS1 was upregulated in the aortas of CKD rats. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) revealed that serum THBS1 levels were increased in CKD patients with thoracic calcification. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis showed that THBS1 expression was increased in calcified vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and arteries. THBS1 knockdown exacerbated rat VSMC calcification induced by high phosphorus and calcium, as shown by Alizarin red staining and calcium content assays. Conversely, THBS1 overexpression attenuated VSMC calcification and abdominal aortic calcification in rats with CKD. Moreover, addition of recombinant THBS1 protein inhibited calcification of VSMCS and human arterial rings. Smooth muscle cell-specific knockout of THBS1 mice treated with vitamin D3 displayed aggravated aortic calcification. Mechanistically, the protein-protein interaction database STRING (http://string-db.org/) analysis and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed THBS1 bound to integrin β3. Reduction of integrin β3 levels abrogated the protective effect of THBS1 on vascular calcification. RNA-seq analysis revealed that THBS1 overexpression modulated the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Of note, the inhibitory effect of THBS1 overexpression on the NF-κB signal was abolished by knockdown of integrin β3. In conclusion, THBS1 interacts with integrin β3 to inhibit vascular calcification through suppression of NF-κB signal, suggesting a promising therapeutic target for vascular calcification in CKD. © 2025 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.	14/03/2025
40073276	CAD manipulates tumor intrinsic DHO/UBE4B/NF-κB pathway and fuels macrophage cross-talk, promoting hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis	Chen Sang , Daming Gao , Dongning Rao , Haokai Qin , Jia Fan, Jian Lin , Jiaomeng Pan, Jiaomeng Pan , Jiaqiang Ma , Juan Zhang , Junjie Ma , Kun Gan , Liuxiao Yang , Mao Zhang , Qiang Gao , Xia Shen , Yingcheng Wu , Yingying Huang , Zheng Tang ,	"Background and aims: Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), an indicator of clinical metastasis, significantly shortens hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients' lifespan, and no effective treatment has been established. We aimed to illustrate mechanisms underlying PVTT formation and tumor metastasis, and identified potential targets for clinical intervention. Approach and results: Multi-omics data of 159 HCC patients (including 37 cases with PVTT) was analyzed to identify contributors to PVTT formation and tumor metastasis. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to confirm the critical role of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD) in HCC metastasis. Metabolomics and transcriptomics techniques, single-cell RNA sequencing, combined with experimental verification were complemented to illustrate mechanisms underlying CAD induced pro-metastatic efficacy. Analysis of proteogenomic data of HCC cohort identified CAD as the key contributor to PVTT formation and tumor metastasis in HCC. Further experiments confirmed that high CAD expression could significantly promote HCC metastasis, and vice versa. Mechanistically, CAD manipulated de novo pyrimidine anabolism, leading to dihydroorotic acid (DHO) accumulation which directly bound to ubiquitination factor E4B (UBE4B). UBE4B subsequently regulated JAK1 ubiquitination and activated the NF-κB pathway to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells. Additionally, CAD generated an immunosuppressive milieu conducive to HCC metastasis by recruiting and reprogramming macrophages into a ""pro-tumor"" phenotype. Consequently, the metastatic capability of HCC was remarkably enhanced. Conclusion: Therapy targeting CAD may offer a promising approach to curb HCC metastasis by reducing tumor cells' metastatic potential and also shifting the tumor microenvironment towards a less pro-metastatic state."	12/03/2025
40090007	Potential Adverse Events of Fluoxetine: A Real-world Study Based on FAERS Database	Haohao Zhu, Qin Zhou , Xiangjun Zhou , Xuezheng Gao, Xuezheng Gao , Ying Jiang , Zhiqiang Du ,	Objective: This study aimed to mine and analyze adverse event signals of fluoxetine using the FAERS database. Methods: This study focused on suspected drug adverse reaction reports from the first quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2023, with fluoxetine as the primary suspected drug. Four signal mining and analysis methods were employed to comprehensively assess adverse event signals. Results: A total of 19,932,732 reports were collected, of which 22,884 were primarily suspected of fluoxetine. Through analysis, 862 PT signals involving 27 SOCs were identified. Among the reported patients, female patients (58.81%) reported a higher proportion than males (26.84%), and the age group of 18 to 45 held the largest percentage. Adverse event signal strength related to pregnancy and neonatal conditions was notable, including Foetal exposure during pregnancy, Exposure during pregnancy, and neonatal health-related adverse events showed higher signal strength, such as Atrial septal defect, Premature baby, Ventricular septal defect, and Maternal drugs affecting the fetus. Conclusion: Although Fluoxetine has been extensively approved and applied, its use in pregnant and planning-to-conceive women should be approached with caution.	16/03/2025
40096550	Sildenafil and risk of Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis	Aaron Shengting Mai , Eng-King Tan, James Jia Dong Wang , Lincoln Kai En Lim , Ling-Ling Chan , Wei Yu Chua, Wei Yu Chua ,	Background: Alzheimer Disease (AD) affects more than 50 million people worldwide, with 10 million new diagnosis each year. The link between Sildenafil, a Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor, and risk of AD has been debated. We conducted the first meta-analysis on the association between Sildenafil use and risk of AD. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and Embase from inception to March 11, 2024 to identify cohort, case-control studies comparing the frequency of AD in patients taking Sildenafil with those without. We computed risk ratios (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) with accompanying 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for each study, and pooled the results using a random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Out of 415 studies that were screened initially, 5 studies comprising 885,380 patients were included for analysis. Sildenafil use was associated with a reduced risk of developing AD by two-fold compared to non-use (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.27-0.82, p<0.001). There was a similar association in risk reduction of AD in patients on PDE5 inhibitors compared to non-use (RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38-0.80, p=0.002). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis showed that the use of Sildenafil is associated with a reduced risk of developing AD by two-fold. Further randomized control trials to ascertain the effect of Sildenafil on AD pathology would be useful.	20/03/2025
40084919	The Omics Landscape of Long COVID-A Comprehensive Systematic Review to Advance Biomarker, Target and Drug Discovery	Anke H Maitland-van der Zee, Elise M A Slob , Harm Jan Bogaard , Korneliusz Golebski , Mahmoud I Abdel-Aziz , Nadia Baalbaki, Nadia Baalbaki , Samuel W Kazer ,	An estimated 10% of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) survivors suffer from persisting symptoms referred to as long COVID (LC), a condition for which approved treatment options are still lacking. This systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42024499281) aimed to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying LC and potential treatable traits across symptom-based phenotypes. We included studies with primary data, written in English, focusing on omics analyses of human samples from LC patients with persistent symptoms of at least 3 months. Our search in PubMed and Embase, conducted on January 8, 2024, identified 642 studies, of which 29 met the inclusion criteria after full-text assessment. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tool. The synthesis of omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics, revealed common findings associated with fatigue, cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and gastrointestinal phenotypes. Key findings included mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated microRNAs associated with pulmonary dysfunction, tissue impairment, blood-brain barrier disruption, coagulopathy, vascular dysfunction, microbiome disturbances, microbial-derived metabolite production and persistent inflammation. Limitations include cross-study heterogeneity and variability in sampling methods. Our review emphasizes the complexity of LC and the need for further longitudinal omics-integrated studies to advance the development of biomarkers and targeted treatments.	14/03/2025

Mechanistically, HPGDS installs a Prostaglandin-D2 (PGD2) autocrine loop in TAMs via DP1 and DP2 activation that sustains their pro-tumoral phenotype and promotes paracrine inhibition of CD8+ T cells via a PGD2-DP1 axis. Genetic or pharmacologic HPGDS targeting induces anti-tumoral features in TAMs and favors CD8+ T-cell recruitment, activation, and cytotoxicity, altogether sensitizing tumors to αPD1. Conversely, HPGDS overexpression in TAMs or systemic TNFα blockade sustains a pro-tumoral environment and αPD1-resistance, preventing the downregulation of HPGDS by T cells. Congruently, patients and mice resistant to αPD1 fail to suppress HPGDS in TAMs, reinforcing the evidence that circumventing HPGDS is necessary for efficient αPD1 treatment. Overall, we disclose a mechanism whereby T-cell activation controls the innate immune system, and we suggest HPGDS/PGD2 targeting to overcome immunotherapy resistance.	18/03/2025

40090317	Pharmacokinetic Properties of Dapagliflozin in Patients with Stage 4 Chronic Kidney Disease	Ancheng Gu, Bianxiang Hu, Dan Li, Dan Li, Di Xie, Jiali He, Jun Li, Jun Wang, Lei Zhang, Min Liang, Wanwen Cao, Xianglan Huang, Xiaobing Yang, Yan Huang, Yaya Yang, Yerong Wei, Zhijian Guo, Zhongyuan Xu,	Introduction: The pharmacokinetic data on dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is limited in patients with severe renal impairment. We aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties and safety of dapagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4. Methods: This was a single center, open label, pharmacokinetic trial involving single and multiple doses. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15-<30 mL/min/1.73m2 were enrolled. The single-dose group received 10mg of oral dapagliflozin once daily, while the multiple-dose group received 10mg daily for five days. Pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacodynamic response and tolerability were assessed. Results: A total of 12 participants completed the single-dose study, and 9 participants completed the multiple-dose study. The mean eGFR was 23.4 and 23.2 mL/min/1.73m2 in single and multiple dose group, respectively. In the single dose group, dapagliflozin was rapidly absorbed and metabolized to produce dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (D3OG) , with a mean Tmax of 0.7 hours and 1.8 hours, and a mean T1/2 of 16.7 hours and 14.9 hours, respectively. Participants with an eGFR of 15-24 mL/min/1.73m2 exhibited higher AUC0-∞ and mean residence time (MRT) for D3OG compared to those with an eGFR of 25-30 mL/min/1.73m2. In the multiple-dose group, there was no significant accumulation of dapagliflozin, as indicated by the ratio of AUCTau (918.6 ± 155.2 h×ng/mL) to AUC0-24h (917.1 ± 154.7 h×ng/mL) was close to 1. In the multiple-dose group, UACR decreased by 21% and 24-hour urinary protein decreased by 23% from baseline to 24 hours after the last dose. Conclusion: In conclusion, no clinically significant accumulation of dapagliflozin was observed in patients with stage 4 CKD.	20/03/2025
40102673	Targeting the histone reader ZMYND8 inhibits antiandrogen-induced neuroendocrine tumor transdifferentiation of prostate cancer	Fei Xavier Chen , Guoying Zhang , Hanling Wang, Hanling Wang # , Jiacheng Guo , Jingyi Zhou , Jun Jiang , Jun Qin, Junyu Xu , Lifan Chen , Mingyue Zheng , Minjia Tan , Naiheng Lin , Ni Li , Qiang Pan # , Qiuli Liu , Sulin Zhang # , Wei Zhang , Weihua Lan , Xiaoyan Cheng , Xuege Wang , Yannan Lian , Yi Zang , Yongqiang Gu , Zige Jin ,	The transdifferentiation from adenocarcinoma to neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) in men confers antiandrogen therapy resistance. Here our analysis combining CRISPR‒Cas9 screening with single-cell RNA sequencing tracking of tumor transition demonstrated that antiandrogen-induced zinc finger MYND-type containing 8 (ZMYND8)-dependent epigenetic programming orchestrates NEPC transdifferentiation. Ablation of Zmynd8 prevents NEPC development, while ZMYND8 upregulation mediated by achaete-scute homolog 1 promotes NEPC differentiation. We show that forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) stabilizes ZMYND8 binding to chromatin regions characterized by H3K4me1-H3K14ac modification and FOXM1 targeting. Antiandrogen therapy releases the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex from the androgen receptor, facilitating its interaction with ZMYND8-FOXM1 to upregulate critical neuroendocrine lineage regulators. We develop iZMYND8-34, a small molecule designed to inhibit ZMYND8's histone recognition, which effectively blocks NEPC development. These findings reveal the critical role of ZMYND8-dependent epigenetic programming induced by androgen deprivation therapy in orchestrating lineage fate. Targeting ZMYND8 emerges as a promising strategy for impeding NEPC development.	18/03/2025
40087540	Programmable solid-state condensates for spatiotemporal control of mammalian gene expression	An-Ping Zeng, Jian Jiang # , Jiawei Shao , Mingqi Xie , Qiqi Xiong , Shichao Li , Yukai Wang, Yukai Wang # ,	Engineering of nuclear condensates with chemically inducible gene switches is highly desired but challenging for precise and on-demand regulation of mammalian gene expression. Here, we harness the phase-separation capability of biomolecular condensates and describe a versatile strategy to chemically program ligand-dependent gene expression at various stages of interest. By engineering synthetic anchor proteins capable of tethering various genetically encoded condensate structures toward different cellular compartments or gene products of interest, inducible regulation of transcriptional and translational activities was achieved at different endogenous and episomal loci using the same sets of anchor proteins and synthetic solid-state condensates. Using such a holistic condensate-based strategy, we not only achieved regulation performances comparing favorably to state-of-the-art strategies described for CRISPR-Cas9 activity and transcriptional silencing but further showed that chemically inducible retention of mRNA molecules into engineered condensate structures within the nucleus can become a remarkably efficient alternative for translational regulation.	14/03/2025

40090887	Left atrial to coronary sinus shunting in more advanced heart failure with preserved ejection fraction	Benjamin Hibbert , Brian A Houston , Firas Zahr , Javed Butler, JoAnn Lindenfeld , Marcus A Urey , Nicholas S Amoroso , Rami Kahwash , Ryan J Tedford, Ryan J Tedford , William A Gray ,	Aims: Inter-atrial shunt device therapy has shown mixed results in clinical trials, with clinical 'non-responders' typically showing features of more advanced heart failure. We aimed to analyse the haemodynamic and clinical response of a novel left atrial to coronary sinus (LA-CS) shunt device in patients with higher natriuretic peptide (NP) levels, a marker of disease severity. Methods and results: An analysis population (n = 95) of patients from the ALT-FLOW early feasibility study with left ventricular ejection fraction >40% and 1-year follow up was analysed. The cohort was divided into low and high subgroups based on NP levels [b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and n-terminal pro BNP (NT-proBNP)]. The mean BNP and NT-proBNP levels for low versus high subgroups were 64.2 ± 34.3 versus 261 ± 103 and 322 ± 269 versus 2050 ± 1070 pg/mL, respectively. Patients in the high NP subgroup had evidence of more advanced disease including worse haemodynamic profiles, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and higher percentages of atrial fibrillation. The high NP subgroup experienced significant improvements in KCCQ-OSS and NYHA functional class (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.001, respectively) and to a similar magnitude compared with the low NP subgroup. Compared with pre-implant baseline, workload adjusted pulmonary artery wedge pressure at peak exercise declined in the high NP subgroup (PCWL, 164.1 vs. 96.0 mmHg/W/kg at 6 months, P < 0.003) as well as the low NP subgroup (115.9 vs. 65.9 mmHg/W/keg at 6 months, P < 0.001). Importantly, in both NP subgroups, there was preservation of cardiac index through 6 months as well as right ventricular structure (right ventricular diastolic dimension) and function (tricuspid annular systolic plane excursion) through 1 year. Conclusions: The quality-of-life, haemodynamic, and functional class improvements along with stable right heart function seen in ALT-FLOW study of LA-CS shunt remain consistent in the subgroup with highest NP levels. This suggests that shunting location could influence outcomes in symptomatic heart failure patients.	16/03/2025
40065102	A functional single-cell metabolic survey identifies Elovl1 as a target to enhance CD8+ T cell fitness in solid tumours	Amir Roshanzadeh , Bernard Thienpont , Charlotte Cresens , Cyril Corbet , Elena Richiardone , Franziska Schneppenheim , Heleen H Van Acker , Johan Swinnen , Jonas Dehairs , Joren Verelst , Lotte Vanheer , Maria Livia Sassano , Mario Di Matteo , Martin Carion , Massimiliano Mazzone, Patrizia Agostinis , Pierre Bourdely # , Qian Yu # , Samantha Pretto, Samantha Pretto , Sarah Trusso Cafarello , Shehab Ismail , Sophia Y Lunt , Susana Rocha , Tobias Bald ,	Reprogramming T cell metabolism can improve intratumoural fitness. By performing a CRISPR/Cas9 metabolic survey in CD8+ T cells, we identified 83 targets and we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to disclose transcriptome changes associated with each metabolic perturbation in the context of pancreatic cancer. This revealed elongation of very long-chain fatty acids protein 1 (Elovl1) as a metabolic target to sustain effector functions and memory phenotypes in CD8+ T cells. Accordingly, Elovl1 inactivation in adoptively transferred T cells combined with anti-PD-1 showed therapeutic efficacy in resistant pancreatic and melanoma tumours. The accumulation of saturated long-chain fatty acids in Elovl1-deficient T cells destabilized INSIG1, leading to SREBP2 activation, increased plasma membrane cholesterol and stronger T cell receptor signalling. Elovl1-deficient T cells increased mitochondrial fitness and fatty acid oxidation, thus withstanding the metabolic stress imposed by the tumour microenvironment. Finally, ELOVL1 in CD8+ T cells correlated with anti-PD-1 response in patients with melanoma. Altogether, Elovl1 targeting synergizes with anti-PD-1 to promote effective T cell responses.	10/03/2025
40065181	Microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease: mechanisms of disease and therapeutic opportunities	Ashwin N Ananthakrishnan , Chun-Jun Guo, Iliyan D Iliev, Iliyan D Iliev ,	Perturbations in the intestinal microbiome are strongly linked to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Bacteria, fungi and viruses all make up part of a complex multi-kingdom community colonizing the gastrointestinal tract, often referred to as the gut microbiome. They can exert various effects on the host that can contribute to an inflammatory state. Advances in screening, multiomics and experimental approaches have revealed insights into host-microbiota interactions in IBD and have identified numerous mechanisms through which the microbiota and its metabolites can exert a major influence on the gastrointestinal tract. Looking into the future, the microbiome and microbiota-associated processes will be likely to provide unparalleled opportunities for novel diagnostic, therapeutic and diet-inspired solutions for the management of IBD through harnessing rationally designed microbial communities, powerful bacterial and fungal metabolites, individually or in combination, to foster intestinal health. In this Review, we examine the current understanding of the cross-kingdom gut microbiome in IBD, focusing on bacterial and fungal components and metabolites. We examine therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities, the microbial metabolism, immunity, neuroimmunology and microbiome-inspired interventions to link mechanisms of disease and identify novel research and therapeutic opportunities for IBD.	10/03/2025
40084843	Exploring the anti-diabetic potential of barnyard millet: insights from virtual screening, MD simulation and MM-PBSA	Bharathi Nathan , Caroline Nirmala Ravikumar , Chakkarai Sathyaseelan , Divya Selvakumar, Pallavi Sukdev Mhaske, Pallavi Sukdev Mhaske , Pavitra Kathirvel , Renuka Raman , Saranya Nallusamy , Vellaikumar Sampathkumar ,	Barnyard millet (Echinochloa frumentacea) is a nutritionally superior grain and a rich source of dietary fiber, and protein. It helps in managing health and dietary issues such as malnutrition, diabetes, obesity, and celiac disease. Its low content of slowly digestible carbohydrates promotes a gradual release of glucose, helping to maintain stable blood glucose levels. The present study aims to identify and screen phytochemicals in the barnyard millet and explore its anti-diabetic activity through an in-silico study. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of the seed extract revealed the occurrence of 73 bioactive compounds that are known to possess a variety of pharmacological activities. Based on the virtual screening analysis, phytochemicals interacted with five different diabetic targets, with diosgenin demonstrating the lowest binding affinity across four receptors. Specifically, diosgenin showed a binding affinity of -9.2 kcal/mol with the Insulin receptor (PDB ID: 1IR3), -8.7 kcal/mol with Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PDB ID: 3G9E), -7.5 kcal/mol with Tyrosine phosphatase 1-beta (2F70), and -6.5 kcal/mol with the Glucagon receptor (PDB ID: 5EE7). For Aldose reductase (PDB ID: 4XZH), Docosahexaenoic acid exhibited the lowest binding affinity of -9.9 kcal/mol. The dynamic behavior of 2F70-Diosgenin docked complexes throughout a 500 ns trajectory run was investigated further. The RMSD and RMSF analyses reveal that the complex remains structurally stable. The binding free energies were computed using the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) methodology. The calculation results show that the predicted free energies of the complex are stable. These results suggest that the 2F70-Diosgenin complex is stable, highlighting its potential for further wet lab validation.	20/03/2025
40089966	The 5-HT Descending Facilitation System Contributes to the Disinhibition of Spinal PKCγ Neurons and Neuropathic Allodynia via 5-HT2C Receptors	Chen-Chen Huang , Jian-Shuai Zhao , Jing Qi , Nan Gu , Qun Wang, Xiao Zhang, Xiao Zhang # , Xiao-Lan He # , Yan Lu , Zhen-Hua Jiang # ,	Neuropathic pain, often featuring allodynia, imposes significant physical and psychological burdens on patients, with limited treatments due to unclear central mechanisms. Addressing this challenge remains a crucial unsolved issue in pain medicine. Our previous study, using protein kinase C gamma (PKCγ)-tdTomato mice, highlights the spinal feedforward inhibitory circuit involving PKCγ neurons in gating neuropathic allodynia. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing this circuit necessitate further elucidation. We used diverse transgenic mice and advanced techniques to uncover the regulatory role of the descending serotonin (5-HT) facilitation system on spinal PKCγ neurons. Our findings revealed that 5-HT neurons from the rostral ventromedial medulla hyperpolarize spinal inhibitory interneurons via 5-HT2C receptors, disinhibiting the feedforward inhibitory circuit involving PKCγ neurons and exacerbating allodynia. Inhibiting spinal 5-HT2C receptors restored the feedforward inhibitory circuit, effectively preventing neuropathic allodynia. These insights offer promising therapeutic targets for neuropathic allodynia management, emphasizing the potential of spinal 5-HT2C receptors as a novel avenue for intervention.	16/03/2025
40088147	The association between chronic pain and metabolic syndrome: A scoping review	Alejandro Hallo-Carrasco , Cara C Prideaux , Christine Hunt, James W Atchison , Johanna Mosquera-Moscoso , Larry Prokop , Laura Furtado Pessoa de Mendonca , Samer Narouze , Sebastian Encalada, Sebastian Encalada ,	Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a prevalent comorbidity in patients with chronic pain conditions. Emerging evidence suggests that the relationship between MetS and chronic pain is bidirectional. This interplay involves complex mechanisms, including proinflammatory mediators in nociceptive modulation and pain-induced lifestyle changes affecting metabolic function. This scoping review examines the association between MetS and chronic pain. We conducted a scoping review, including 28 studies. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. We included observational studies (cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies) from the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. We identified studies on migraine (n = 9), spinal pain (n = 8), general chronic pain (n = 4), fibromyalgia syndrome (n = 3), carpal tunnel syndrome (n = 1), osteoarthritis (n = 1), shoulder pain (n = 1), and neuropathic pain (n = 1). Most studies used a cross-sectional design and standard criteria to define MetS, with some exceptions. Individuals with MetS and spinal pain, fibromyalgia, or general chronic pain showed higher pain scores and increased functional limitations. MetS was common in patients with migraine, but its effect on pain severity was inconclusive. The relationship between MetS and other pain conditions requires further investigation to clarify the association and potential mechanisms. MetS is prevalent in patients with chronic pain and is associated with worse pain and functional outcomes. Health care providers should acknowledge the wide spectrum of MetS beyond obesity. This understanding may help identify those at risk for more severe chronic pain.	15/03/2025
40074903	Perception of viral infections and initiation of antiviral defence in rice	Changtian Chen , Chunhong Wei , He Wang , Jia-Jia Han , Jiahao Li , Jialin Yang # , Linlin Du , Qi Xie , Shengze Yao , Shuo Li , Tong Zhou , Wenming Wang , Xi Sun # , Xiaoqiang Cao , Yanhong Han , Yi Li, Yinghua Ji , Yu Huang, Yu Huang # , Zhirui Yang ,	Crop production faces persistent threats from insect-vector-borne viral diseases1,2. Recent advancements have revealed the intricate immune mechanisms that plants deploy against viral pathogens3-8. However, the molecular mechanisms through which plant hosts recognize viral infections and initiate antiviral defence at disease onset have not been elucidated. Here, through the natural infection of rice by inoculation with insect vectors carrying the natural forms of viruses, we show that viral coat proteins are perceived by the RING1-IBR-RING2-type ubiquitin ligase (RBRL), initiating the first step of the natural antiviral response in rice. RBRL subsequently targets an adaptor protein of the transcriptional repression complex of the jasmonate pathway, NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ 3 (NINJA3), for degradation through the ubiquitination system, inducing jasmonate signalling and activating downstream antiviral defence. We further show that this phenomenon is a universal molecular mechanism used by rice plants to perceive viral infections and initiate antiviral signalling cascades. This approach is important not only for obtaining a deeper understanding of virus-host interactions but also for further disease resistance breeding.	12/03/2025
40087028	Drug-drug interactions in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC): practical considerations for treating men with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors and common medications in this stage	Cristina Ibáñez, Cristina Ibáñez , Cristina Moretones , David Conde-Estévez, Emilio Ríos , Fernando López-Campos , Manuel Tourís-Lores , Paola Usán , Álvaro Montesa ,	Introduction: New androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) are an essential part of the treatment strategy for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Despite the good tolerability of ARPIs, after treatment is started, drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between these and other medications frequently taken by these patients may appear. DDIs may reduce the therapeutic effect of both and lead to increased adverse events. DDIs should be carefully assessed before an ARPI is started. Areas covered: We first review the current therapeutic landscape for mHSPC, common age-related comorbidities and other comorbidities or adverse events arising from previous or current treatments for prostate cancer, and patients' symptomatology. We then analyze the potential toxicities arising from medications for these conditions and those of mHSPC: ARPIs (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide) and docetaxel. Expert opinion: Before mHSPC patients are treated with an ARPI, careful assessment of patient eligibility for each treatment alternative and potential DDIs between these and treatments for current comorbidities is a fundamental component in clinical decision-making. ARPIs with low potential DDIs allow keeping current concomitant medications without significant relevant dose adjustments and help reduce the risk of toxicities and comorbidity-related decompensation.	20/03/2025
40085352	From Clinic to Mechanisms: Multi-Omics Provide New Insights into Cerebrospinal Fluid Metabolites and the Spectrum of Psychiatric Disorders	Bin Yu , Hongwei Liu , Jie Wen, Jie Wen # , Jingwei Zhang, Yingjie Li # , Yongzhen Li , Yu Chen , Zhiwei Xia ,	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is crucial in maintaining brain homeostasis by facilitating waste clearance, nutrient transport, and immune signaling. However, the links between CSF metabolites and psychiatric disorders, as well as the underlying mechanisms, remain largely unexamined. We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate potential causal relationships between CSF metabolites and 12 psychiatric disorders. Summary data for psychiatric disorders were sourced from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, while information on CSF metabolites was derived from two studies within the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease cohort. Causal estimates and pleiotropy were assessed using several robust methods, including inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) analysis, weighted median analysis, MR-Egger regression, and the MR-Egger test. Furthermore, a transcriptome-wide association study was conducted to explore potential mechanisms and shared etiologies between CSF metabolites and psychiatric disorders. The genetic risk of eating disorders (ED) can be increased by leucine (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.21-1.97, P = 4.35 × 10⁻4), salicylate (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04, P = 4.95 × 10⁻4), and 1-methylnicotinamide (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03-1.09, P = 6.94 × 10⁻6), while methylmalonate may reduce ED risk (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93-0.98, P = 1.31 × 10⁻4). Similarly, the risk of schizophrenia (SCZ) may be reduced by threonate (OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89-0.97, P = 1.98 × 10⁻4), oxalate (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90-0.97, P = 3.15 × 10⁻4), phenyllactate (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.98, P = 2.23 × 10⁻4), N-acetylglucosamine (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99, P = 3.57 × 10⁻5), and citramalate (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.98-0.99, P = 5.78 × 10⁻4). Conversely, SCZ may upregulate gamma-glutamylleucine (β = 0.08, P = 1.97 × 10⁻4) and O-sulfo-L-tyrosine (β = 0.06, P = 1.25 × 10⁻4), while downregulating gamma-glutamylphenylalanine (β = - 0.50, P = 1.16 × 10⁻4). Signal pathways related to the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR), post-translational protein modifications, and immune regulation may mediate the causal relationship of CSF metabolites on ED and SCZ. We identified a casual genetic causal relationship between CSF metabolites and both ED and schizophrenia SCZ, which is potentially mediated by pathways related to energy metabolism, post-translational modifications, and immune regulation.	14/03/2025
40065171	Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell therapy with laromestrocel in mild Alzheimer's disease: a randomized controlled phase 2a trial	Alan F Jacobson , Ana Fuquay , Anthony A Oliva Jr # , Brad Herskowitz , Brian G Rash, Brian G Rash # , Brittany Varnado , Eric Naioti , Jeffrey Botbyl , Joshua M Hare, Julie B Schwartzbard , Kevin N Ramdas # , Kevin Peterson , Lisa McClain-Moss , Mark Brody , Michael Brown , Michael Pfeffer , Nataliya Agafonova , Paayal Patel , Ramon Leon , Raul Carballosa , Savannah Rodriguez , Steven Kopcho , Thiago Leal , Zarin Zainul ,	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, severe brain atrophy and neuroinflammation. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2a clinical trial that tested the safety and efficacy of laromestrocel, a bone-marrow-derived, allogeneic mesenchymal stem-cell therapy, in slowing AD clinical progression, atrophy and neuroinflammation. Participants across ten centers in the United States were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to four infusion groups: group 1 (placebo; four monthly infusions, n = 12); group 2 (25 million cells, one infusion followed by three monthly infusions of placebo, n = 13); group 3 (25 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 13); and group 4 (100 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 11). The study met its primary end point of safety; the rate of treatment-emergent serious adverse events within 4 weeks of any infusion was similar in all four groups: group 1, 0% (95% CI 0-26.5%); group 2, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%); group 3, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%) and group 4, 9.1% (95% CI 0.2-41.3%). Additionally, there were no reported infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivities or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Laromestrocel improved clinical assessments at 39 weeks compared to placebo, as measured by a composite AD score (secondary end point was met: group 2 versus placebo change: 0.38; 95% CI -0.06-0.82), Montreal cognitive assessment and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living. At 39 weeks, Laromestrocel slowed the decline of whole brain volume compared to placebo (n = 10) by 48.4% for all treatment groups combined (groups 2-4: P = 0.005; n = 32) and left hippocampal volume by 61.9% (groups 2-4, P = 0.021; n = 32), and reduced neuroinflammation as measured by diffusion tensor imaging. The change in bilateral hippocampal atrophy correlated with the change in mini-mental state exam scores (R = 0.41, P = 0.0075) in all study patients (N = 42). Collectively these results support safety of single and multiple doses of laromestrocel treatment for mild AD and provide indications of efficacy in combating decline of brain volume and potentially cognitive function. Larger-scale clinical trials of laromestrocel in AD are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05233774 .	10/03/2025
40102636	Fibrosis: cross-organ biology and pathways to development of innovative drugs	Boris Hinz , Florian Rieder, Florian Rieder # , Jörg H W Distler , Laura E Nagy , Marco Prunotto #, Rafael Kramann , Toby M Maher ,	Fibrosis is a pathophysiological mechanism involved in chronic and progressive diseases that results in excessive tissue scarring. Diseases associated with fibrosis include metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), chronic kidney disease (CKD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), which are collectively responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Although a few drugs with direct antifibrotic activity are approved for pulmonary fibrosis and considerable progress has been made in the understanding of mechanisms of fibrosis, translation of this knowledge into effective therapies continues to be limited and challenging. With the aim of assisting developers of novel antifibrotic drugs, this Review integrates viewpoints of biologists and physician-scientists on core pathways involved in fibrosis across organs, as well as on specific characteristics and approaches to assess therapeutic interventions for fibrotic diseases of the lung, gut, kidney, skin and liver. This discussion is used as a basis to propose strategies to improve the translation of potential antifibrotic therapies.	18/03/2025
40099365	Atrial Translocation of Porphyromonas gingivalis Exacerbates Atrial Fibrosis and Atrial Fibrillation	Ayako Nakajima , Fumie Shiba , Hiromi Nishi , Hiroyuki Kawaguchi , Hisako Furusho , Hitoshi Komatsuzawa , Kazuhisa Ouhara , Masae Kitagawa , Miki Kawada-Matsuo , Mutsumi Miyauchi , Noboru Oda , Pham Trong Phat , Shinya Takahashi , Sho Okamura , Shunsuke Miyauchi, Shunsuke Miyauchi , Taiichi Takasaki , Takehito Tokuyama , Toru Hiyama , Yousaku Okubo , Yukiko Nakano	Background: Recent studies have indicated an association between periodontitis and atrial fibrillation (AF), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a causative agent of periodontal disease and is highly pathogenic. This study focused on P gingivalis and aimed to investigate the relationship among periodontitis, atrial translocation of P gingivalis, and atrial fibrosis and AF. Methods: An experiment was conducted using P gingivalis-infected C57BL/6J mice, in which P gingivalis was inoculated into the pulp of the molars. Immunohistochemistry was used to visualize the localization of P gingivalis, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification was employed to detect P gingivalis DNA in the left atrium. AF inducibility was examined by intracardiac stimulation. Moreover, left atrial appendage specimens were obtained from 68 patients with AF. A periodontal examination was conducted before the surgery, and the periodontal epithelial surface area and periodontal inflamed surface area, which are quantitative indices used to determine the clinical severity of periodontitis, were measured. The bacterial number of P gingivalis in human atrial tissue was analyzed via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Atrial fibrosis was assessed using Azan-Mallory staining. Results: The translocation path of P gingivalis from the dental granuloma to the left atrium via the circulatory system was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and loop-mediated isothermal amplification in P gingivalis-infected mice, which showed a higher degree of atrial fibrosis (21.9% versus 16.3%; P=0.0003) and a higher AF inducibility (30.0% versus 5.0%; P=0.04) than the control mice. Upregulation of GAL3 (galectin 3) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 in the left atrium was observed in P gingivalis-infected mice. Moreover, immunohistochemistry revealed that P gingivalis was also present in human atrial tissue. The number of P gingivalis in the human atrial tissue was positively correlated with periodontal epithelial surface area (ρ=0.35; P=0.004), periodontal inflamed surface area (ρ=0.52, P<0.0001), and the degree of atrial fibrosis (ρ=0.38; P=0.002). Conclusions: P gingivalis translocation to the left atrium correlates with the clinical severity of periodontitis, which may exacerbate atrial fibrosis and AF. Atrial translocation of P gingivalis is a potential pathway explaining the causal relationship between periodontitis and AF.	18/03/2025
40097814	Developmental mitochondrial complex I activity determines lifespan	Alberto Sanz #, Alejandro Huerta Uribe , Beatriz Castejon-Vega , Fiona Robertson , Kevin Myers , L Miguel Martins , Oliver D K Maddocks , Rhoda Stefanatos, Rhoda Stefanatos # , Tetsushi Kataura , Viktor I Korolchuk , Yizhou Yu ,	Aberrant mitochondrial function has been associated with an increasingly large number of human disease states. Observations from in vivo models where mitochondrial function is altered suggest that maladaptations to mitochondrial dysfunction may underpin disease pathology. We hypothesized that the severity of this maladaptation could be shaped by the plasticity of the system when mitochondrial dysfunction manifests. To investigate this, we have used inducible fly models of mitochondrial complex I (CI) dysfunction to reduce mitochondrial function at two stages of the fly lifecycle, from early development and adult eclosion. Here, we show that in early life (developmental) mitochondrial dysfunction results in severe reductions in survival and stress resistance in adulthood, while flies where mitochondrial function is perturbed from adulthood, are long-lived and stress resistant despite having up to a 75% reduction in CI activity. After excluding developmental defects as a cause, we went on to molecularly characterize these two populations of mitochondrially compromised flies, short- and long-lived. We find that our short-lived flies have unique transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic responses, which overlap significantly in discrete models of CI dysfunction. Our data demonstrate that early mitochondrial dysfunction via CI depletion elicits a maladaptive response, which severely reduces survival, while CI depletion from adulthood is insufficient to reduce survival and stress resistance.	17/03/2025
