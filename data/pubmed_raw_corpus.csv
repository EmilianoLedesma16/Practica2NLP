However, that climate-trait match can be disrupted by historical events, with lasting ecosystem impacts. As Earth's environment changes faster than at any time in human history, critical questions are whether and how organismal traits and ecosystems can adjust to altered conditions. We quantified the relative importance of current environmental forcing versus evolutionary history in shaping the growth form (stature and biomass) and associated community of eelgrass (Zostera marina), a widespread foundation plant of marine ecosystems along Northern Hemisphere coastlines, which experienced major shifts in distribution and genetic composition during the Pleistocene. We found that eelgrass stature and biomass retain a legacy of the Pleistocene colonization of the Atlantic from the ancestral Pacific range and of more recent within-basin bottlenecks and genetic differentiation. This evolutionary legacy in turn influences the biomass of associated algae and invertebrates that fuel coastal food webs, with effects comparable to or stronger than effects of current environmental forcing. Such historical lags in phenotypic acclimatization may constrain ecosystem adjustments to rapid anthropogenic climate change, thus altering predictions about the future functioning of ecosystems.",09/08/2022
10.3390/jimaging10080192,RailTrack-DaViT: A Vision Transformer-Based Approach for Automated Railway Track Defect Detection.,"Phaphuangwittayakul A, Harnpornchai N, Ying F, Zhang J",Journal of imaging,"Railway track defects pose significant safety risks and can lead to accidents, economic losses, and loss of life. Traditional manual inspection methods are either time-consuming, costly, or prone to human error. This paper proposes RailTrack-DaViT, a novel vision transformer-based approach for railway track defect classification. By leveraging the Dual Attention Vision Transformer (DaViT) architecture, RailTrack-DaViT effectively captures both global and local information, enabling accurate defect detection. The model is trained and evaluated on multiple datasets including rail, fastener and fishplate, multi-faults, and ThaiRailTrack. A comprehensive analysis of the model's performance is provided including confusion matrices, training visualizations, and classification metrics. RailTrack-DaViT demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based methods, achieving the highest accuracies: 96.9% on the rail dataset, 98.9% on the fastener and fishplate dataset, and 98.8% on the multi-faults dataset. Moreover, RailTrack-DaViT outperforms baselines on the ThaiRailTrack dataset with 99.2% accuracy, quickly adapts to unseen images, and shows better model stability during fine-tuning. This capability can significantly reduce time consumption when applying the model to novel datasets in practical applications.",07/08/2024

Previous studies have demonstrated that dysfunctional meningeal lymphatics evoke behavioral changes, but the neural mechanisms underlying these changes have remained elusive. Here, we show that prolonged impairment of meningeal lymphatics alters the balance of cortical excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, accompanied by deficits in memory tasks. These synaptic and behavioral alterations induced by lymphatic dysfunction are mediated by microglia, leading to increased expression of the interleukin 6 gene (Il6). IL-6 drives inhibitory synapse phenotypes via a combination of trans- and classical IL-6 signaling. Restoring meningeal lymphatic function in aged mice reverses age-associated synaptic and behavioral alterations. Our findings suggest that dysfunctional meningeal lymphatics adversely impact cortical circuitry through an IL-6-dependent mechanism and identify a potential target for treating aging-associated cognitive decline.",14/03/2025
10.3390/jimaging10090227,Leveraging Perspective Transformation for Enhanced Pothole Detection in Autonomous Vehicles.,"Abu-Raddaha A, El-Shair ZA, Rawashdeh S",Journal of imaging,"Road conditions, often degraded by insufficient maintenance or adverse weather, significantly contribute to accidents, exacerbated by the limited human reaction time to sudden hazards like potholes. Early detection of distant potholes is crucial for timely corrective actions, such as reducing speed or avoiding obstacles, to mitigate vehicle damage and accidents. This paper introduces a novel approach that utilizes perspective transformation to enhance pothole detection at different distances, focusing particularly on distant potholes. Perspective transformation improves the visibility and clarity of potholes by virtually bringing them closer and enlarging their features, which is particularly beneficial given the fixed-size input requirement of object detection networks, typically significantly smaller than the raw image resolutions captured by cameras. Our method automatically identifies the region of interest (ROI)-the road area-and calculates the corner points to generate a perspective transformation matrix. This matrix is applied to all images and corresponding bounding box labels, enhancing the representation of potholes in the dataset. This approach significantly boosts detection performance when used with YOLOv5-small, achieving a 43% improvement in the average precision (AP) metric at intersection-over-union thresholds of 0.5 to 0.95 for single class evaluation, and notable improvements of 34%, 63%, and 194% for near, medium, and far potholes, respectively, after categorizing them based on their distance. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to employ perspective transformation specifically for enhancing the detection of distant potholes.",14/09/2024
10.3390/jimaging10080197,A Multi-Scale Target Detection Method Using an Improved Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network Based on Enhanced Backbone and Optimized Mechanisms.,"Chen Q, Li M, Lai Z, Zhu J, Guan L",Journal of imaging,"Currently, existing deep learning methods exhibit many limitations in multi-target detection, such as low accuracy and high rates of false detection and missed detections. This paper proposes an improved Faster R-CNN algorithm, aiming to enhance the algorithm's capability in detecting multi-scale targets. This algorithm has three improvements based on Faster R-CNN. Firstly, the new algorithm uses the ResNet101 network for feature extraction of the detection image, which achieves stronger feature extraction capabilities. Secondly, the new algorithm integrates Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM), Soft non-maximum suppression (Soft-NMS), and Distance Intersection Over Union (DIOU) modules, which improves the positive and negative sample imbalance and the problem of small targets being easily missed during model training. Finally, the Region Proposal Network (RPN) is simplified to achieve a faster detection speed and a lower miss rate. The multi-scale training (MST) strategy is also used to train the improved Faster R-CNN to achieve a balance between detection accuracy and efficiency. Compared to the other detection models, the improved Faster R-CNN demonstrates significant advantages in terms of mAP@0.5, F1-score, and Log average miss rate (LAMR). The model proposed in this paper provides valuable insights and inspiration for many fields, such as smart agriculture, medical diagnosis, and face recognition.",13/08/2024
10.3390/jimaging10090215,"Concrete Crack Detection and Segregation: A Feature Fusion, Crack Isolation, and Explainable AI-Based Approach.","Swarna RA, Hossain MM, Khatun MR, Rahman MM, Munir A",Journal of imaging,"Scientific knowledge of image-based crack detection methods is limited in understanding their performance across diverse crack sizes, types, and environmental conditions. Builders and engineers often face difficulties with image resolution, detecting fine cracks, and differentiating between structural and non-structural issues. Enhanced algorithms and analysis techniques are needed for more accurate assessments. Hence, this research aims to generate an intelligent scheme that can recognize the presence of cracks and visualize the percentage of cracks from an image along with an explanation. The proposed method fuses features from concrete surface images through a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) and curvelet transform handcrafted (HC) method, optimized by linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) classifier then uses these features to recognize cracks. This study evaluates several CNN models, including VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception-V3, and ResNet-50, and various HC techniques, such as wavelet transform, counterlet transform, and curvelet transform for feature extraction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and LDA are assessed for feature optimization. For classification, XGB, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and category boosting (CatBoost) are tested. To isolate and quantify the crack region, this research combines image thresholding, morphological operations, and contour detection with the convex hulls method and forms a novel algorithm. Two explainable AI (XAI) tools, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIMEs) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping++ (Grad-CAM++) are integrated with the proposed method to enhance result clarity. This research introduces a novel feature fusion approach that enhances crack detection accuracy and interpretability. The method demonstrates superior performance by achieving 99.93% and 99.69% accuracy on two existing datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the development of an algorithm for isolating and quantifying crack regions represents a significant advancement in image processing for structural analysis. The proposed approach provides a robust and reliable tool for real-time crack detection and assessment in concrete structures, facilitating timely maintenance and improving structural safety. By offering detailed explanations of the model's decisions, the research addresses the critical need for transparency in AI applications, thus increasing trust and adoption in engineering practice.",31/08/2024

Here, we present long-term MRD status and PFS outcomes after an 80.1-month median follow-up. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to daratumumab plus VTd (D-VTd) or VTd induction/consolidation; patients remaining on study were re-randomized to daratumumab maintenance or observation for £2 years. MRD status was assessed at pre-defined timepoints during each study phase. D-VTd improved overall MRD-negativity rates (10-5) post-induction (34.6% vs 23.1%; P<0.0001) and post-consolidation (63.7% vs 43.7%; P<0.0001) and provided PFS benefit, regardless of post-induction MRD status, versus VTd alone. Daratumumab maintenance improved overall MRD-negativity rates over observation, regardless of induction/consolidation treatment (D-VTd/daratumumab vs D-VTd/observation: 10-5, 77.3% vs 70.7% [P=0.0417]; 10-6, 60.7% vs 52.0% [P=0.0365]; VTd/daratumumab vs VTd/observation: 10-5, 70.9% vs 51.2% [P<0.0001]; 10-6, 48.4% vs 30.7% [P<0.0001]), and improved MRD-negativity rates, regardless of risk status, as defined by cytogenetic abnormalities or revised International Staging System score. Further, daratumumab maintenance provided PFS benefit versus observation, regardless of induction/consolidation treatment and post-consolidation MRD status. D-VTd followed by daratumumab maintenance consistently produced the highest landmark, accumulative, and sustained MRD-negativity rates (10-5 and 10-6), translating to superior long-term PFS outcomes. These results demonstrate that daratumumab-based induction/consolidation followed by daratumumab maintenance resulted in the deepest and most durable MRD negativity, leading to superior PFS outcomes.",24/03/2025
10.3390/jimaging10090208,Task-Adaptive Angle Selection for Computed Tomography-Based Defect Detection.,"Wang T, Florian V, Schielein R, Kretzer C, Kasperl S, Lucka F, van Leeuwen T",Journal of imaging,"Sparse-angle X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) plays a vital role in industrial quality control but leads to an inherent trade-off between scan time and reconstruction quality. Adaptive angle selection strategies try to improve upon this based on the idea that the geometry of the object under investigation leads to an uneven distribution of the information content over the projection angles. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as an effective approach for adaptive angle selection in X-ray CT. While previous studies focused on optimizing generic image quality measures using a fixed number of angles, our work extends them by considering a specific downstream task, namely image-based defect detection, and introducing flexibility in the number of angles used. By leveraging prior knowledge about typical defect characteristics, our task-adaptive angle selection method, adaptable in terms of angle count, enables easy detection of defects in the reconstructed images.",23/08/2024

OBJECTIVE: To compare microultrasonography-guided and MRI fusion-guided biopsy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter, international, open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial of biopsy-naive men from 20 centers (8 countries) with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (elevated prostate-specific antigen [PSA] and/or abnormal digital rectal examination findings) from December 2021 to September 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were assigned to receive either microultrasonography-guided biopsy (n = 121), microultrasonography/MRI fusion-guided biopsy (microultrasonography/MRI; n = 226, in which microultrasonography biopsies were performed prior to unblinding the MRI), or MRI/conventional US fusion-guided biopsy (MRI/conventional ultrasonography; n = 331). All participants received synchronous systematic biopsy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the difference in detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancers using microultrasonography plus systematic biopsy vs MRI/conventional ultrasonography plus systematic biopsy. The secondary outcome was the difference in detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancers found using microultrasonography/MRI plus systematic biopsy vs MRI/conventional ultrasonography plus systematic biopsy. The noninferiority margin was set at 10%. RESULTS: A total of 802 men underwent randomization and 678 underwent biopsy. Median (IQR) age was 65 (59-70) years and prostate-specific antigen level was 6.9 (5.2-9.8) ng/mL; 83% self-identified as White. Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancer was detected in 57 participants (47.1%) in the microultrasonography group, in 141 (42.6%) in the MRI/conventional ultrasonography group, and in 106 (46.9%) in the microultrasonography/MRI group. Microultrasonography-guided biopsy was noninferior to MRI fusion-guided biopsy (difference, 3.52% [95% CI, -3.95% to 10.92%]; noninferiority P < .001). Combined biopsy with microultrasonography/MRI was also noninferior to MRI/conventional ultrasonography software-assisted MRI fusion biopsy using conventional ultrasonography devices (difference, 4.29% [95% CI, -4.06% to 12.63%]; noninferiority P < .001). The rate of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancer diagnosed by targeted biopsy only was 38.0% in the microultrasonography group, 34.1% in the MRI/conventional ultrasonography group, and 40.3% in the microultrasonography/MRI group; these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The use of microultrasonography-guided biopsy was noninferior to MRI/conventional ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy for the detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher prostate cancer in biopsy-naive men. Microultrasonography may provide an alternative to MRI for image-guided prostate biopsy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05220501.",23/03/2025
10.1038/s41467-025-57879-3,Associations of 2923 plasma proteins with incident inflammatory bowel disease in a prospective cohort study and genetic analysis.,"Zhang X, Zhao H, Wan M, Man J, Zhang T, Yang X, Lu M",Nature communications,"The prospective relationship between proteomics and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains largely underexplored, presenting potential of therapeutic interventions. Using data from 48,800 IBD-free participants in the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP), we assessed associations between 2923 plasma proteins and incident IBD risk using Cox analysis. Mendelian randomization (MR) meta-analysis, integrating cis-protein quantitative trait loci data from the UKB-PPP with IBD genome-wide association study data from the International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium and FinnGen studies, identified causal proteins. Colocalization analysis strengthened evidence of shared common causal variants. Cohort study revealed associations of 673, 295, and 125 proteins with the risk of IBD, Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC), respectively. MR and colocalization analyses prioritized IL12B, CD6, MXRA8, CXCL9, IFNG, CCN3, RSPO3, and IL18 as having causal and high colocalization evidence with IBD or its subtypes. Our findings advance understanding of IBD's molecular etiology and highlight potential therapeutic targets.",21/03/2025
10.1038/s41586-025-08732-6,VDAC2 loss elicits tumour destruction and inflammation for cancer therapy.,"Yuan S, Sun R, Shi H, Chapman NM, Hu H, Guy C, Rankin S, Kc A, Palacios G, Meng X, Sun X, Zhou P, Yang X, Gottschalk S, Chi H",Nature,"Tumour cells often evade immune pressure exerted by CD8(+) T cells or immunotherapies through mechanisms that are largely unclear(1,2). Here, using complementary in vivo and in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screens to target metabolic factors, we established voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) as an immune signal-dependent checkpoint that curtails interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated tumour destruction and inflammatory reprogramming of the tumour microenvironment. Targeting VDAC2 in tumour cells enabled IFNγ-induced cell death and cGAS-STING activation, and markedly improved anti-tumour effects and immunotherapeutic responses. Using a genome-scale genetic interaction screen, we identified BAK as the mediator of VDAC2-deficiency-induced effects. Mechanistically, IFNγ stimulation increased BIM, BID and BAK expression, with VDAC2 deficiency eliciting uncontrolled IFNγ-induced BAK activation and mitochondrial damage. Consequently, mitochondrial DNA was aberrantly released into the cytosol and triggered robust activation of cGAS-STING signalling and type I IFN response. Importantly, co-deletion of STING signalling components dampened the therapeutic effects of VDAC2 depletion in tumour cells, suggesting that targeting VDAC2 integrates CD8(+) T cell- and IFNγ-mediated adaptive immunity with a tumour-intrinsic innate immune-like response. Together, our findings reveal VDAC2 as a dual-action target to overcome tumour immune evasion and establish the importance of coordinately destructing and inflaming tumours to enable efficacious cancer immunotherapy.",19/03/2025

We present a comprehensive analysis of spatial patterns and temporal trends in exposure and attributable disease from 1990 to 2021, featuring substantial methodological updates compared with previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, including improved exposure estimations accounting for specific fuel types. METHODS: We estimated HAP exposure and trends and attributable burden for cataract, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, tracheal cancer, bronchus cancer, lung cancer, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and causes mediated via adverse reproductive outcomes for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We first estimated the mean fuel type-specific concentrations (in μg/m(3)) of fine particulate matter (PM(2·5)) pollution to which individuals using solid fuels for cooking were exposed, categorised by fuel type, location, year, age, and sex. Using a systematic review of the epidemiological literature and a newly developed meta-regression tool (meta-regression: Bayesian, regularised, trimmed), we derived disease-specific, non-parametric exposure-response curves to estimate relative risk as a function of PM(2·5) concentration. We combined our exposure estimates and relative risks to estimate population attributable fractions and attributable burden for each cause by sex, age, location, and year. FINDINGS: In 2021, 2·67 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2·63-2·71) people, 33·8% (95% UI 33·2-34·3) of the global population, were exposed to HAP from all sources at a mean concentration of 84·2 μg/m(3). Although these figures show a notable reduction in the percentage of the global population exposed in 1990 (56·7%, 56·4-57·1), in absolute terms, there has been only a decline of 0·35 billion (10%) from the 3·02 billion people exposed to HAP in 1990. In 2021, 111 million (95% UI 75·1-164) global disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were attributable to HAP, accounting for 3·9% (95% UI 2·6-5·7) of all DALYs. The rate of global, HAP-attributable DALYs in 2021 was 1500·3 (95% UI 1028·4-2195·6) age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population, a decline of 63·8% since 1990, when HAP-attributable DALYs comprised 4147·7 (3101·4-5104·6) age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population. HAP-attributable burden remained highest in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, with 4044·1 (3103·4-5219·7) and 3213·5 (2165·4-4409·4) age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population, respectively. The rate of HAP-attributable DALYs was higher for males (1530·5, 1023·4-2263·6) than for females (1318·5, 866·1-1977·2). Approximately one-third of the HAP-attributable burden (518·1, 410·1-641·7) was mediated via short gestation and low birthweight. Decomposition of trends and drivers behind changes in the HAP-attributable burden highlighted that declines in exposures were counteracted by population growth in most regions of the world, especially sub-Saharan Africa. INTERPRETATION: Although the burden attributable to HAP has decreased considerably, HAP remains a substantial risk factor, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Our comprehensive estimates of HAP exposure and attributable burden offer a robust and reliable resource for health policy makers and practitioners to precisely target and tailor health interventions. Given the persistent and substantial impact of HAP in many regions and countries, it is imperative to accelerate efforts to transition under-resourced communities to cleaner household energy sources. Such initiatives are crucial for mitigating health risks and promoting sustainable development, ultimately improving the quality of life and health outcomes for millions of people.

Here, LAG3 was found to undergo robust non-K48-linked polyubiquitination upon ligand engagement, which promotes LAG3's inhibitory function instead of causing degradation. This ubiquitination could be triggered by the engagement of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) and membrane-bound (but not soluble) fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1). LAG3 ubiquitination, mediated redundantly by the E3 ligases c-Cbl and Cbl-b, disrupted the membrane binding of the juxtamembrane basic residue-rich sequence, thereby stabilizing the LAG3 cytoplasmic tail in a membrane-dissociated conformation enabling signaling. Furthermore, LAG3 ubiquitination is crucial for the LAG3-mediated suppression of antitumor immunity in vivo. Consistently, LAG3 therapeutic antibodies repress LAG3 ubiquitination, correlating with their checkpoint blockade effects. Moreover, patient cohort analyses suggest that LAG3/CBL coexpression could serve as a biomarker for response to LAG3 blockade. Collectively, our study reveals an immune-checkpoint-triggering mechanism with translational potential in cancer immunotherapy.",06/03/2025

Based on our previous data, a multiple choice questionnaire has been developed. The aim is to perform a quantitative analysis of the results obtained from an international survey and to describe the clinical practice worldwide. Ten questions were related to participants' demographics and, 20 questions (of which 17 Likert scale questions) investigated the DMP regarding PI creation. To evaluate the tendency of the answers in the Likert-type questions, the mean of the answers obtained was compared with the mean point of the Likert scale. The survey was completed by 1019 physicians. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and distance of the anastomosis from the anal verge ≤ 10 cm were each considered alone sufficient to justify creation of a PI, with statistically significant differences in comparison to the mean point of the scales in (p = < 0.0001 in both cases). Total Mesorectal Excision alone was not considered a factor sufficient to create a PI (p = 0.416). Most of the participants agree to define their approach to create a PI ""tailored"" to patients' risk factors (p = < 0.0001) and ""influenced by my experience"" in case of patients with low/moderate risk of anastomotic leakage (p = < 0.0001). This study provides useful insights on the worldwide clinical practice regarding creation of PI following anterior resection.

However, it remains unclear how BCL11B suppresses natural killer (NK) cell transcriptional programs. Here, we identified that the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 physically interacts with BCL11B, increasing BCL11B stability and the fidelity of DNA methylation maintenance for NK cell-related genes, thereby repressing their expression. Moreover, DNMT1 maintains the epigenetic silencing of a distinct subset of NK cell-related genes independent of BCL11B. DNMT1 inhibition or depletion reprograms T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells into NK-like cells that exhibit more robust antitumor effects than BCL11B-deficient ITNKs and parental CAR-T cells. Moreover, H3K27me3 (trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27) synergizes with DNA methylation to repress NK cell-related pathways, and combined EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) and DNMT1 inhibition potentiates both the reprogramming and cytotoxicity of NK-like cells.

RESULTS: Metformin use was associated with increased grip strength (OR = 2.46; 95% CI 1.49-2.38) and skeletal muscle mass (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 0.20-2.28), as well as reduced mortality (HR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.54-0.71). MR analysis suggested a possible link between GDF15 gene expression and sarcopenia traits, with no evidence of genetic confounding. Molecular docking indicated stable binding between metformin and GDF15. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that metformin may lower sarcopenia risk, particularly in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes, with GDF15 identified as a promising target for sarcopenia treatment.",21/03/2025

Oncolytic viruses selectively replicate in and lyse cancer cells, releasing neoantigens and stimulating systemic antitumour immunity(3), offering a potential therapeutic option. Here we present the results of a multicentre phase 1 clinical trial evaluating VG161, an engineered oncolytic herpes simplex virus that expresses IL-12, IL-15, IL-15Rα and a PD-1-PD-L1-blocking fusion protein(4), for safety and efficacy in patients with advanced liver cancer. VG161 was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed, and it demonstrated promising efficacy by reshaping the tumour immune microenvironment and re-sensitizing tumours that were previously resistant to systemic treatments. Notably, we also found that patients who had previously been sensitive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy showed enhanced efficacy with VG161 treatment. Furthermore, we developed an efficacy-prediction model based on differentially expressed genes, which successfully identified patients who were likely to benefit from VG161 and predicted prolonged overall survival. These findings position VG161 as a promising third-line therapeutic option for refractory hepatocellular carcinoma. This provides a new avenue for treatment and advances the field of oncolytic virus-based immunotherapies. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04806464 .",19/03/2025

If microorganisms overcome those barriers, however, innate immune cells use toxic chemicals to kill the invading cells(2,3). Here we examine immune diversity across tissues and identify a population of neutrophils in the skin that expresses a broad repertoire of proteins and enzymes needed to build the extracellular matrix. In the naive skin, these matrix-producing neutrophils contribute to the composition and structure of the extracellular matrix, reinforce its mechanical properties and promote barrier function. After injury, these neutrophils build 'rings' of matrix around wounds, which shield against foreign molecules and bacteria. This structural program relies on TGFβ signalling; disabling the TGFβ receptor in neutrophils impaired ring formation around wounds and facilitated bacterial invasion. We infer that the innate immune system has evolved diverse strategies for defence, including one that physically shields the host from the outside world.",19/03/2025

However, the mechanisms regulating adipocyte functions remain unclear. Here, using multi-omics analyses, involving (phospho-)proteomics and lipidomics, we found that day-restricted feeding (DRF) regulates diurnal rhythms of the mitochondrial proteome, neutral lipidome, and nutrient-sensing pathways in mouse gonadal white adipose tissue (GWAT). Adipocyte-specific knockdown of Prkaa2 (the gene encoding AMPKα2) impairs physical endurance. This defect is associated with altered rhythmicity in acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) metabolism-related genes, a loss of rhythmicity in the GWAT lipidome, and circadian remodeling of serum metabolites-in particular, lactate and succinate. We also found that adipocyte Prkaa2 regulates muscle clock genes during DRF. Notably, oral administration of the AMPK activator C29 increases endurance and muscle functions in a time-of-day manner, which requires intact adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling. Collectively, our work defines adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling as a critical regulator of circadian metabolic coordination between fat and muscle, thereby enhancing exercise performance.",12/03/2025

In this study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive description of the phenotypic expression, natural history, and clinical outcomes of patients with this ARVC subset. METHODS: Genetic and clinical data of DSG2 and DSC2 variant carriers were collected from 5 countries in Europe and Asia. We assessed the phenotypic profile of these patients and their clinical outcomes, focusing on heart failure and ventricular arrhythmia events. RESULTS: Overall, 271 subjects, 254 with DSG2 variants, were included in this study (median age, 38 years [interquartile range, 25-52]; 62.7% male). Of these, 165 were probands, and 200 were diagnosed with definite ARVC. A total of 181 (66.8%) individuals carried missense variants, mainly distributed in the extracellular domains. Notably, we included 78 (28.8%) individuals with multiple variants. Of the 200 cases with diagnosed ARVC, 41 (20.5%) experienced premature cardiac death before the age of 65. Among the 81 individuals for whom both left ventricular ejection fraction and right ventricular fractional area change data were available at presentation, 29 (35.8%) had isolated right ventricular dysfunction, and 16 (19.8%) had biventricular dysfunction. Single-variant carriers who engaged in intense physical exercise were younger at disease onset compared with those who did not (P=0.001). Compared with single-variant carriers, those with multiple variants were more likely to be diagnosed with ARVC (96.2% versus 64.8%; P<0.001) and exhibited more severe left ventricular dysfunction (44.4% versus 22.1%; P=0.001) and right ventricular dilation (88.9% versus 55.8%, P<0.001). Multiple-variant carriers were significantly younger at ARVC diagnosis compared with single-variant carriers (33 [18-49] years versus 42 [27-54] years; P<0.001]. During follow-up, end-stage heart failure (P<0.001) and malignant ventricular arrhythmias (P=0.004) were significantly more frequent in multiple-variant compared with single-variant carriers. Compared with PKP2 patients, DSG2/DSC2 patients exhibited a significantly higher risk of end-stage heart failure (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ARVC attributable to variants in desmosomal cadherins mostly present with right ventricular or biventricular disease. Multiple variants are common in these patients and are associated with more frequent clinical penetrance, earlier onset of disease, and adverse clinical outcomes.",24/03/2025

Mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) transport damaged mitochondrial components to lysosomes or the extracellular space. While many metabolites are known to modulate mitochondrial dynamics, it is largely unclear whether they are involved in MDV generation. Here, we discovered that the major component of ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), improved mitochondrial functions by facilitating the biogenesis of MDVs. Mechanistically, BHB drove specific lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) of sorting nexin-9 (SNX9), a key regulator of MDV biogenesis. Kbhb increased SNX9 interaction with inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM)/matrix proteins and promoted the formation of IMM/matrix MDVs. SNX9 Kbhb was not only critical for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in cells but also protected mice from alcohol-induced liver injury. Altogether, our research uncovers the fact that metabolites influence the formation of MDVs by directly engaging in post-translational modifications of key protein machineries and establishes a framework for understanding how metabolites regulate mitochondrial functions.",14/03/2025

Neurology,"BACKGROUND: Amyloid plaque removal by monoclonal antibody therapies slows clinical progression in symptomatic Alzheimer's disease; however, the potential for delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in asymptomatic people is unknown. The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) is an ongoing platform trial assessing the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational products in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). Based on findings of amyloid removal and downstream biological effects from the gantenerumab group of the platform trial, we continued a 3-year open-label extension (OLE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with high doses of gantenerumab. METHODS: The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 multi-arm trial (DIAN-TU-001) assessed solanezumab or gantenerumab versus placebo in participants who were between 15 years before and 10 years after their estimated years to symptom onset and who had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0 (cognitively normal) to 1 (mild dementia). This study was followed by an OLE study of gantenerumab treatment, conducted at 18 study sites in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Spain, the UK, and the USA. For inclusion in the OLE, participants at risk for DIAD had participated in the double-blind period of DIAN-TU-001 and were required to know their mutation status. We investigated increasing doses of subcutaneous gantenerumab up to 1500 mg every 2 weeks. Due to the lack of a regulatory path for gantenerumab, the study was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis (when most participants had completed 2 years of treatment) of the clinical measure CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). The primary outcome for the final analysis was the amyloid plaque measure (11)C-Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR [PiB-PET SUVR]) at 3 years, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat group (mITT; defined as participants who received any gantenerumab treatment post-OLE baseline, had at least one PiB-PET SUVR assessment before gantenerumab treatment, and a post-baseline assessment). All participants who received at least one dose of study drug in the OLE were included in the safety analysis. DIAN-TU-001 (NCT01760005) and the OLE (NCT06424236) are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. FINDINGS: Of 74 participants who were recruited into the OLE study between June 3, 2020, and April 22, 2021, 73 were enrolled and received gantenerumab treatment. 47 (64%) stopped dosing due to early termination of the study by the sponsor, and 13 (18%) prematurely discontinued the study for other reasons; 13 people completed 3 years of treatment. The mITT group for the primary analysis comprised 55 participants. At the interim analysis, the hazard ratio for clinical decline of CDR-SB in asymptomatic mutation carriers was 0·79 (n=53 [95% CI 0·47 to 1·32]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab in either the double-blind or OLE period (Any Gant), and 0·53 (n=22 [0·27 to 1·03]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab the longest (Longest Gant). At the final analysis, the adjusted mean change from OLE baseline to year 3 in PiB-PET SUVR was -0·71 SUVR (95% CI -0·88 to -0·53, p<0·0001). Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities occurred in 53% (39 of 73) of participants: 47% (34 of 73) with microhaemorrhages, 30% (22 of 73) with oedema, and 6% (five of 73) were associated with superficial siderosis. No treatment-associated macrohaemorrhages or deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Partial or short-term amyloid removal did not show significant clinical effects. However, long-term full amyloid removal potentially delayed symptom onset and dementia progression. Our conclusions are limited due to the OLE design and use of external controls and need to be confirmed in long-term trials.

The unfolded protein response alleviating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress involves activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) that impedes translation by mRNA decay. We discover that the IRE1α digestion motif is present in insulin mRNA carrying SNP rs3842752 (G>A). This SNP in the 3' untranslated region of INS associates with protection from T1D (INS(P)). ER stress in beta cells with INS(P) led to accelerated insulin mRNA decay compared with the susceptible INS variant (INS(S)). Human islets with INS(P) showed improved vitality and function and reversed diabetes more rapidly when transplanted into diabetic mice than islets carrying INS(S) only. Surrogate beta cells with INS(P) expressed less ER stress and INS-DRiP neoantigen. This explanation for genetic protection from T1D may act instead of or in concert with the previously proposed mechanism attributed to INS promoter polymorphism.,11/03/2025

In addition, prior research is limited by small sample sizes and a failure to account for the competitive effects of other CRM diseases. METHODS: In this study, data obtained from the large-scale, prospective UK Biobank cohort were used. CRM multimorbidity was defined as the new-onset of ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease during follow-up. Multivariable Cox regression was used to analyse the independent association between TyG-BMI and each CRM multimorbidity (first, double, or triple CRM diseases). The C-statistic was calculated for each model, and a restricted cubic spline was applied to assess the dose-response relationship. A multi-state model was used to investigate the association between TyG-BMI and the trajectory of CRM multimorbidity (from baseline [without CRM disease] to the first CRM disease, the first CRM disease to double disease, and double disease to triple disease), with disease-specific analyses. RESULTS: This study included 349,974 participants, with a mean age of 56.05 (standard deviation [SD], 8.08), 55.93% of whom were female. Over a median follow-up of approximately 14 years, 56,659 (16.19%) participants without baseline CRM disease developed at least one CRM disease, including 8451 (14.92%) who progressed to double CRM disease and 789 (9.34%) who further developed triple CRM disease. In the crude model, each SD increase in TyG-BMI was associated with a 47% higher risk of the first CRM disease, a 72% higher risk of double CRM disease, and a 95% higher risk of triple CRM disease, with C-statistics of 0.625, 0.694, and 0.764, respectively. Multi-state model analysis showed a 32% increased risk of new CRM disease, a 24% increased risk of progression to double CRM disease, and a 23% increased risk of further progression for those with double CRM diseases. TyG-BMI was significantly associated with the onset of all individual first CRM diseases (except for stroke) and with the transition to double CRM disease. Significant interactions were also observed, but TyG-BMI remained significantly associated with CRM multimorbidity across subgroups. Sensitivity analyses, including varying time intervals for entering states and an expanded CRM definition (including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, obesity, and dyslipidaemia), confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: TyG-BMI remarkably influences the onset and progression of CRM multimorbidity. Incorporating it into CRM multimorbidity prevention and management could have important public health implications.",21/03/2025

METHODS: We included consecutive adult patients admitted with a diagnosis of CS requiring vasopressors. High-dose vasopressors (HDV) were defined as ≥0.3 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine equivalent. Multivariable logistic regression and propensity analysis was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values for in-hospital mortality, before and after adjustment for relevant covariates. RESULTS: We included 721 CS patients, including HDV in 32.5%. Vasopressin was administered in 207 (29%) patients within the first 24 hours. In-hospital mortality occurred in 38.1% and was higher in the HDV group (56.8% vs. 29.2%). Vasopressin was associated with lower propensity adjusted in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.99, p = 0.05). Vasopressin use was also associated with lower mortality in the HDV group (unadjusted OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.92, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Vasopressin use in the first 24 hours was associated with lower adjusted mortality in patients with CS, particularly amongst those requiring HDV. The use of vasopressin in CS merits dedicated prospective evaluation.",20/03/2025

Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures fail to propagate a large subpopulation of murine primary tumors in vitro. However, three-dimensional (3D) air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures, which are employed to grow normal lung organoids, can be used to efficiently culture cancerous lung tumor cells. Here, we detail a procedure for cultivating genetically modified lung organoids in 3D-ALI cultures. This protocol contains two parts. The first part describes how to transduce lung epithelial cells, which are either freshly sorted from lungs or from actively growing murine organoids, with virus in order to modify gene expression. The target lung cells are incubated with virus for 1-2 h for transduction. Then, the transduced cells are thoroughly washed and mixed with stromal support cells and Matrigel and are loaded into transwell inserts for culture and validated for genetic modifications through downstream assays. The second part describes how to isolate tumor cells growing orthotopically in genetically engineered mouse models to produce organoid cell lines that can be used for ex vivo drug discovery assays. For this protocol, tumors are isolated from lungs of mice, finely chopped and washed. Then, tumor chunks are mixed with Matrigel for 3D-ALI culture. Finally, organoids budding from tumor chunks are trypsinized and passaged to establish an organoid line. Together these two protocols provide a promising platform to study the genesis, progression, and treatment of lung cancer.",//2024

Inspired by the partial resistance to TGFβ of NK cells with SMAD4 haploinsufficiency, we used CRISPR-Cas9 for knockout of SMAD4 in human NK cells. Here we show that SMAD4(KO) NK cells were resistant to TGFβ and activin A inhibition, retaining their cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion and interleukin-2/interleukin-15-driven proliferation. They showed enhanced tumor penetration and tumor growth control, both as monotherapy and in combination with tumor-targeted therapeutic antibodies. Notably, SMAD4(KO) NK cells outperformed control NK cells treated with a TGFβ inhibitor, underscoring the benefit of maintaining SMAD4-independent TGFβ signaling. SMAD4(KO) conferred TGFβ resistance across diverse NK cell platforms, including CD19-CAR NK cells, stem cell-derived NK cells and ADAPT-NK cells. These findings position SMAD4 knockout as a versatile and compelling strategy to enhance NK cell antitumor activity, providing a new avenue for improving NK cell-based cancer immunotherapies.",21/03/2025

Manipulating interorgan communication is considered a promising strategy for managing metabolic disease, including steatohepatitis. Here, we report that remote limb ischemic conditioning (RIC), a clinically validated therapy for distant organ protection by transient muscle ischemia, significantly alleviated steatohepatitis in different mouse models. The beneficial effect of limb ischemic conditioning was mediated by muscle-to-liver transfer of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and their cargo microRNAs, leading to elevation of miR-181d-5p in the liver. Hepatic miR-181d-5p overexpression faithfully mirrored the molecular and histological benefits of limb ischemic conditioning by suppressing nuclear receptor 4A3 (NR4A3). Furthermore, circulating EVs from human volunteers undergoing limb ischemic conditioning improved steatohepatitis and transcriptomic perturbations in primary human hepatocytes and animal models.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We included 9,026 and 389,616 participants from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and the UK Biobank study (UKB), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the cross-sectional association of diabetes with anemia, as defined by hemoglobin measurement. For the UKB follow-up, multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of incident anemia, as defined by hemoglobin levels or diagnosis records, in relation to diabetes. We further assessed the impact of inflammation, renal dysfunction, and medication use on this association in both populations. RESULTS: Among White people aged 40-69 years in the U.S. and U.K., the adjusted odds of study participants with diagnosed diabetes also having anemia was two to four times higher than in those with normal glycemia. Over a median follow-up of 13.6 years in the UKB, 42,354 people developed anemia. The adjusted HRs for incident anemia comparing diagnosed diabetes with normal glycemia were 3.05 (95% CI 2.90-3.21) for iron deficiency anemia, 3.02 (95% CI 2.51-3.63) for anemia of chronic disease, and 4.88 (95% CI 4.23-5.63) for vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. Further adjustment for inflammation, renal dysfunction, and medication use partially attenuated these associations, but they remained strong and significant. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes was associated with several major types of anemia. Further studies are warranted to identify the mechanisms.",21/03/2025

Our research reveals that dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT), a pyruvate metabolism enzyme, promotes leucine accumulation and sustains mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex activation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mechanistically, DLAT directly acetylates the K109 residue of AU RNA-binding methylglutaconyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydratase (AUH), a critical enzyme in leucine catabolism, inhibiting its activity and leading to leucine accumulation. Notably, DLAT upregulation correlates with poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Therefore, we developed an AUH(K109R)-mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) therapeutic strategy, which effectively inhibits tumor growth by restoring leucine catabolism and inhibiting mTOR activation in vivo. In summary, our findings uncover DLAT's unexpected role as an acetyltransferase for AUH, suppressing leucine catabolism. Restoring leucine catabolism with AUH(K109R)-mRNA LNP effectively inhibits HCC development, highlighting a novel direction for cancer research.",13/03/2025

The cellular and molecular heterogeneity of the endometrium in women with PCOS has not been well studied. Our study presents a comprehensive cellular atlas of the endometrium during the proliferative phase in women with PCOS characterized by overweight and obesity, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance compared with controls of similar age, weight and body mass index. Analysis of 247,791 isolated endometrial nuclei from 27 biopsies (5 controls and 12 PCOS cases at baseline and 7 after 16 weeks of metformin and 3 after lifestyle intervention) revealed cell-type-specific disease signatures and variations in cellular composition and localization. Samples taken after 16 weeks of metformin treatment and lifestyle management showed extensive recovery of disease-specific endometrial signatures. We linked the specific role of each cell type to clinical features such as hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance, and specific cell types to risk of endometrial and metabolic disease. In addition, potential therapeutic targets such as integrin inhibitors were identified and the role of metformin in restoring endometrial health in patients with PCOS was highlighted. Our findings lay the groundwork to significantly advance the understanding of PCOS-specific endometrial dysfunction for future targeted therapies.",20/03/2025

OBJECTIVE: To identify a novel protumoural CAF subtype undertaking VM. DESIGN: We used single-cell RNA sequencing and mIHC to identify FAPα(+)CD144(+) endothelial-like CAFs (endoCAFs) and combined prospective and retrospective analyses to assess its clinical outcomes. Tube formation, proliferation and invasion assay were conducted on cell lines, organoids, the orthotopic tumour model and LSL-Kras(G12D/+), LSL-Trp53(R172H/+) and Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mouse model. Mechanically, we performed cytokine array assays, RNA-sequencing, IP-mass spectrometry, ChIP and luciferase analyses. Importantly, an siRNA delivery nanosystem was developed to precisely target FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs in vivo. RESULTS: FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs were present in the tumour microenvironment of PDAC, and patients with a higher CD144(+)CAFs proportion displayed poor prognosis of PDAC. FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs not only acquired a VM phenotype to provide metastatic conduits but also promoted the proliferation and invasion of tumour cells in situ through paracrine signalling, thereby actively facilitating the metastasis of tumour cells. The CD144-β-catenin-STAT3 signalling axis was activated, and CD144 and downstream secreted cytokines were transcriptionally upregulated to maintain the dual roles of endoCAFs. A CAF-targeting siRNA delivery nanosystem, via loading FAPα and siCD144, was administered to precisely target FAPα(+)CD144(+) endoCAFs, which substantially inhibited their protumoural roles in vivo. CONCLUSION: FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs can promote metastasis of PDAC via undertaking VM and paracrine through activation of the CD144-β-catenin-STAT3 signalling axis. CAF-targeting siRNA delivery nanosystem can inhibit tumour progression by precisely targeting FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs.",23/03/2025

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by perineural invasion and modulated by autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) and sensory innervations. Here, we further demonstrated that within the tumor microenvironment of PDAC, nociceptor neurons interacted with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) through calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and nerve growth factor (NGF). This interaction led to the inhibition of interleukin-15 expression in CAFs, suppressing the infiltration and cytotoxic function of natural killer (NK) cells and thereby promoting PDAC progression and cancer pain. In PDAC patients, nociceptive innervation of tumor tissue is negatively correlated with the infiltration of NK cells while positively correlated with pain intensity. This association serves as an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival and relapse-free survival for PDAC patients. Our findings highlight the crucial regulation of NK cells by nociceptor neurons through interaction with CAFs in the development of PDAC. We also propose that targeting nociceptor neurons or CGRP signaling may offer a promising therapy for PDAC and cancer pain.",24/03/2025

Furthermore, research on the underlying mechanisms has mostly been limited to laboratory and animal models, with few large-scale population-based studies. METHODS: Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2021, we analyzed disability-adjusted life years and mortality for CVD attributable to APMP (measured as particulate matter [PM](2.5)) from 1990 to 2021. We examined shifts in burden between APMP and household air pollution (HAP), regional disparities by socio-demographic index (SDI), and predicted trends using a Bayesian age-period-cohort model. Additionally, we used UK Biobank (UKB) data (metabolomics: 230,000 + participants; proteomics: 50,000 +) to identify biomarkers mediating the association between PM(2.5) exposure and CVD outcomes, and further analyzed their biological roles. Metabolic and proteomic signatures were constructed using regression and elastic net models, with predictive performance assessed via time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis. Life expectancy was evaluated using flexible parametric survival models. Subgroup analysis was conducted by age, sex, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and genetic susceptibility. RESULTS: In 2021, the global CVD absolute burden attributable to APMP was more than double that of 1990, with significant regional disparities. The burden shifted from HAP to APMP, with 15% of CVD cases globally attributed to APMP. The CVD burden attributable to APMP increased with age and is projected to rise through 2030. In the UKB, approximately 30 metabolites, including albumin, mediated the association between PM(2.5) exposure and CVD outcomes, primarily involving lipid and fatty acids metabolism. Over 60 proteins, including growth differentiation factor-15 and trefoil factor 2, mediated the association with CVD outcomes, enriched in cytokine-receptor interaction and leukocyte migration pathways. Metabolic and proteomic signatures outperformed PM(2.5) alone in predicting 1-, 5-, and 10-year CVD outcomes. Participants in the lowest decile of PM(2.5) exposure, metabolic, and proteomic signatures had longer life expectancy than those in the highest decile. CONCLUSION: The CVD burden attributable to APMP remains a critical public health concern. This study presents a novel approach for identifying and managing susceptible populations through metabolomic and proteomic perspectives.",22/03/2025

Public health,"BACKGROUND: Given Japan's rapidly ageing demographic structure, comprehensive and long-term evaluations of its national and subnational health progress are important to inform public health policy. This study aims to assess Japan's population health, using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 to analyse the country's evolving disease patterns. METHODS: GBD 2021 used Japanese data from 1474 sources, covering 371 diseases, including COVID-19, and 88 risk factors. The analysis included estimates of life expectancy, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Estimates were generated using the standardised GBD methodology, which incorporates various data sources through statistical modelling, including the Cause Of Death Ensemble Model for mortality, Bayesian Meta-Regression Disease Model for non-fatal outcomes, and risk factor estimation frameworks to quantify attributable burdens. Life expectancy decomposition by cause of death and annualised rates of change of age-standardised mortality and DALYs were calculated for 1990-2005, 2005-15, and 2015-21. FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2021, life expectancy in Japan rose from 79·4 years (95% uncertainty interval 79·3-79·4) to 85·2 years (85·1-85·2), with prefecture-level disparities widening. Gains were primarily driven by reduced mortality from stroke (adding 1·5 years to life expectancy), ischaemic heart disease (1·0 years), and neoplasms, particularly stomach cancer (0·5 years), with variation across prefectures. Leading causes of death in 2021 were Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (135·3 deaths [39·5-312·3] per 100 000 population), stroke (114·9 [89·8-129·3] per 100 000), ischaemic heart disease (96·5 [77·7-106·7] per 100 000), and lung cancer (72·1 [61·8-77·5] per 100 000). Age-standardised mortality for major non-communicable diseases declined, but the pace of this decline has slowed. All-cause annualised rate of change in mortality rate decreased from -1·6% for 2005-15 to -1·1% for 2015-21. Age-standardised COVID-19 mortality rates were 0·8 deaths (0·7-0·9) per 100 000 population (accounting for 0·3% of all deaths) in 2020 and 3·0 (2·5-3·7) per 100 000 population in 2021 (1·0% of deaths). Age-standardised DALY rates for diabetes worsened, with annualised rate of change increasing from 0·1% for 2005-15 to 2·2% for 2015-21. This change parallels worsening trends in major risk factors, particularly high fasting plasma glucose (annualised rate of change of attributable DALYs -0·8% for 2005-15 and 0·8% for 2015-21) and high BMI (0·2% and 1·4%, respectively). Age-standardised DALYs attributable to other major risk factors continued to decrease, albeit slower. INTERPRETATION: Japan's health gains over the past 30 years are now stalling, with rising regional disparities. The increasing burdens of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and diabetes, alongside high fasting plasma glucose and high BMI, highlight areas needing focused attention and action.

Suzetrigine, an oral, non-opioid, small molecule, selectively inhibits the voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (NaV1.8) and has potential to provide efficacious and safe relief for acute pain, without addiction concerns. METHODS: To evaluate suzetrigine for treatment of acute pain, we conducted two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trials in adults with moderate-to-severe acute pain on the verbal categorical rating scale and ≥4 on the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) after abdominoplasty (N=1118) or bunionectomy (N=1073). After surgery, participants were randomized to suzetrigine (100mg then 50mg every 12hrs), hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen (HB/APAP; 5/325mg every 6hrs), or placebo for 48 hours. The primary endpoint was time-weighted sum of the pain intensity difference in NPRS from 0-48hrs (SPID48) versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints were SPID48 versus HB/APAP and time to ≥2-point reduction in NPRS from baseline versus placebo. RESULTS: The primary endpoint was achieved in both trials with suzetrigine demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in pain versus placebo. The least squares mean difference in SPID48 between suzetrigine and placebo was 48.4 (95%CI:33.6,63.1;P<0.0001) after abdominoplasty and 29.3 (95%CI:14.0,44.6; P=0.0002) after bunionectomy. Neither trial achieved the first key secondary endpoint of superiority of suzetrigine versus HB/APAP on SPID48. For the second key secondary endpoint of time to ≥2-point reduction in NPRS, suzetrigine had a more rapid onset of clinically meaningful pain relief versus placebo after abdominoplasty (119min versus 480mins, nominal P<0.0001) and bunionectomy (240mins versus 480mins, nominal P=0.0016).Adverse events (AEs) were similar to those seen in post-surgical settings. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with placebo, suzetrigine reduced moderate-to-severe acute pain over 48 hours after abdominoplasty or bunionectomy. Pain reduction with suzetrigine was similar to that with HB/APAP. Suzetrigine was associated with adverse events that were mild to moderate in severity.

Oncology,"BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of individuals with oesophageal cancer have a pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and oesophagectomy. We aimed to investigate whether active surveillance could be an alternative for individuals with a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in 12 Dutch hospitals. Individuals with locally advanced oesophageal cancer and a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (ie, no tumour detected with endoscopic biopsies, ultrasound, and PET-CT) underwent active surveillance or standard surgery (ie, oesophagectomy within 2 weeks after reaching clinical complete response). There were no inclusion restrictions regarding comorbidities or performance status, but participants had carcinoma, were age 18 years or older, and were treated with curative intent. Randomisation of hospitals was performed using computer-generated sequences without stratification methods, after an initial phase of all hospitals performing standard surgery. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed according to a modified intention-to-treat principle (allowing crossover at time of clinical complete response) and an intention-to-treat principle. Non-inferiority was defined as 2-year survival rate for active surveillance of 15% or less below that for standard surgery. The trial was registered within the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR-6803, and the inclusion phase has been completed. FINDINGS: Between Nov 8, 2017, and Jan 17, 2021, 1115 individuals were screened, of whom 309 were included. 198 underwent active surveillance and 111 underwent standard surgery. 242 (78%) participants were male and 67 (22%) were female. Median follow-up was 38 months (IQR 32-48). 2-year overall survival for active surveillance (74% [95% CI 69-78]) was non-inferior to standard surgery (71% [62-78]) after modified intention-to-treat analysis (one-sided 95% boundary: 7% lower). It remained non-inferior in the intention-to-treat analysis (75% [68-80] vs 70% [63-77], one-sided 95% boundary: 6% lower). There were no significant differences in overall survival according to modified intention-to-treat analysis (hazard ratio 1·14, two-sided 95% CI 0·74-1·78) or intention-to-treat analysis (0·83, 0·53-1·31). The frequency of postoperative complications and postoperative mortality after standard surgery or postponed surgery after active surveillance was similar between groups. INTERPRETATION: Overall survival after active surveillance for oesophageal cancer was non-inferior compared with standard surgery after 2 years. For the long-term efficacy of active surveillance, extended follow-up is required. The results of the present trial could be used for patient counselling and shared decision making.

In this study, we investigated the feasibility of mitochondria transplantation as a potential therapeutic approach to rescue cerebellar neurodegeneration and elucidate the associated mechanisms. We constructed a conditional Drp1 knockout model in PCs (PCKO mice), characterized by progressive ataxia. Drp1 knockout resulted in pervasive and progressive apoptosis of PCs and significant activation of surrounding glial cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggers mitophagy, is a key pathogenic factor contributing to morphological and functional damage in PCs. Transplanting liver-derived mitochondria into the cerebellum of 1-month-old PCKO mice improved mitochondrial function, reduced mitophagy, delayed apoptosis of PCs, and alleviated cerebellar ataxia for up to 3 weeks.

By single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Parkin deficiency reshapes the TIME through activating both innate and adaptive immunities to control tumor progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5-dependent autophagy.

Leveraging the Latino Colorectal Cancer Consortium (LC3) and other existing datasets, we analyzed whole exome sequencing data on tumor/normal pairs from 718 individuals with colorectal cancer to map somatic mutational features by ethnicity and genetic similarity. Global proportions of African, Asian, European, and Native American genetic ancestries were estimated using ADMIXTURE. Associations between these proportions and somatic mutational features were examined using logistic regression. APC, TP53, and KRAS were the top three mutated genes across all participants and in the subset of Latino individuals in LC3. In analyses examining recurrently mutated genes, tumors from patients of Latino ethnicity had fewer KRAS and PIK3CA mutations compared to tumors from non-Latino patients. Genetic ancestry overall was associated with CDC27 mutation status, and African genetic ancestry was associated with SMAD2 mutation status. In exome-wide analyses, African genetic ancestry was significantly associated with higher odds of mutation in KNCN and TMEM184B. Native American genetic ancestry was associated with a lower frequency of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. The SBS11 mutational signature was associated with Native American genetic ancestry as well as Latino ethnicity. In an independent replication dataset, MSK-IMPACT, estimates of association were largely consistent in direction, but non-significant. A meta-analysis of LC3 and MSK-IMPACT showed that African genetic ancestry was significantly associated with KRAS mutation status and MSI status.

Here we present genetically informed spatial mapping of cells for complex traits (gsMap), a method that integrates spatial transcriptomics data with summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to map cells to human complex traits, including diseases, in a spatially resolved manner. Using embryonic spatial transcriptomics datasets covering 25 organs, we benchmarked gsMap through simulation and by corroborating known trait-associated cells or regions in various organs. Applying gsMap to brain spatial transcriptomics data, we reveal that the spatial distribution of glutamatergic neurons associated with schizophrenia more closely resembles that for cognitive traits than that for mood traits such as depression. The schizophrenia-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the dorsal hippocampus, with upregulated expression of calcium signalling and regulation genes, whereas depression-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the deep medial prefrontal cortex, with upregulated expression of neuroplasticity and psychiatric drug target genes.

The study used survey data from a sample of 480 girls resident in Iwaya community. A survival analysis of the timing of onset of sex and a regression model for involvement in multiple sexual partnerships reveal that among the forms of deprivation explored, food deprivation is the only significant predictor of the timing of onset of sex and involvement in multiple sexual partnerships.

Mandimycin is biosynthesized by the mand gene cluster, has evolved in a distinct manner from known polyene macrolide antibiotics and is modified with three deoxy sugars. It has demonstrated potent and broad-spectrum fungicidal activity against a wide range of multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens in both in vitro and in vivo settings. In contrast to known polyene macrolide antibiotics that target ergosterol, mandimycin has a unique mode of action that involves targeting various phospholipids in fungal cell membranes, resulting in the release of essential ions from fungal cells. This unique ability to bind multiple targets gives it robust fungicidal activity as well as the capability to evade resistance. The identification of mandimycin using the phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery strategy represents an important advancement in uncovering antimicrobial compounds with distinct modes of action, which could be developed to combat multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens.",19/03/2025

We aimed to establish novel comprehensive evaluation scales for cachexia specific to patients with solid tumours. METHODS: This study included 12 651 patients (males: 6793 [53.7%]; females: 5858 [46.3%]; medium age: 58 [interquartile range:50/66] years; medium follow-up duration: 24.16 [13.32/44.84] months; 4271 [33.8%] patients died; mean survival: 55.53 [95% confidence interval, 54.87/56.10] months; 3344 [26.4%], 4184 [33.1%] and 5123 [40.5%] patients with Stage I-II, III and IV tumour, respectively; derivation set: 10022, validation set: 2629 patients) with 14 types of solid tumours, including lung, gastric, liver, breast, oesophageal, cervical, bladder, pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, colorectal cancer, nasopharyngeal and endometrial carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, from an open and ongoing multicentre cohort study in China. Risk factors for cachexia, including tumour characteristics and nutritional parameters, were examined to develop diagnostic scales using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Ten nutrition items (body mass index, weight loss, intake reduction, physical activity function, fatigue, handgrip strength, anorexia, albumin level, albumin/globulin ratio and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) with different weighted scores were identified to construct a nutrition-weighted scoring scale (NWSS) for nutrition risk. Tumour type and tumour burden status (tumour-node-metastasis stage and radical or non-radical tumour) were determined to construct a disease-weighted scoring scale (DWSS) for disease risk. A lumped scale (5 × 5 matrix) established using a five-grade classification of nutrition and disease risk was used to determine a five-grade classification of comprehensive cachexia risk: A, no cachexia risk (reference; lowest disease and nutrition risks); B, cachexia risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.517 [4.033/5.058]); C, pre-cachexia (HR = 9.755 [8.73/10.901], medium survival = 21.21 months); D, cachexia (HR = 16.901 [14.995/19.049], medium survival = 11.61 months); and E, refractory cachexia (HR = 31.879 [28.244/35.981], medium survival = 4.83 months, highest disease and nutrition risks) (p < 0.001). Patients in Categories A-D benefited from nutrition therapy and anti-tumour treatments to varying degrees. Patients in Category E were clinically refractory to nutrition therapy without prolonged survival compared with patients without nutrition therapy (medium survival, pre-hospitalization nutrition therapy vs. hospitalization nutrition therapy vs. without nutrition therapy, 2.89 [1.91/3.88] vs. 4.04 [3.21/4.88] vs. 5.89 [4.73/7.04] months, p = 0.015) and anti-tumour treatments without prolonged survival compared with patients receiving palliative care (medium survival, radical anti-tumour treatments vs. adjuvant anti-tumour treatments vs. palliative anti-tumour treatments vs. and palliative care, 6.48 [4.42/8.53] vs. 6.48 [3.23/9.73] vs. 4.83 [4.22/5.44] vs. 2.70 [1.09/4.30] months, p = 0.263). CONCLUSION: We systematically developed a novel definition and grading diagnostic criteria for tumour-type-specific comprehensive cancer cachexia risk.",/04/2025
