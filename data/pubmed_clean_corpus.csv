However, that climate-trait match can be disrupted by historical events, with lasting ecosystem impacts. As Earth's environment changes faster than at any time in human history, critical questions are whether and how organismal traits and ecosystems can adjust to altered conditions. We quantified the relative importance of current environmental forcing versus evolutionary history in shaping the growth form (stature and biomass) and associated community of eelgrass (Zostera marina), a widespread foundation plant of marine ecosystems along Northern Hemisphere coastlines, which experienced major shifts in distribution and genetic composition during the Pleistocene. We found that eelgrass stature and biomass retain a legacy of the Pleistocene colonization of the Atlantic from the ancestral Pacific range and of more recent within-basin bottlenecks and genetic differentiation. This evolutionary legacy in turn influences the biomass of associated algae and invertebrates that fuel coastal food webs, with effects comparable to or stronger than effects of current environmental forcing. Such historical lags in phenotypic acclimatization may constrain ecosystem adjustments to rapid anthropogenic climate change, thus altering predictions about the future functioning of ecosystems.

Kim K, Abramishvili D, Du S, Papadopoulos Z, Cao J, Herz J, Smirnov I, Thomas JL, Colonna M, Kipnis J	Meningeal lymphatics serve as an outlet for cerebrospinal fluid, and their dysfunction is associated with various neurodegenerative conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated that dysfunctional meningeal lymphatics evoke behavioral changes, but the neural mechanisms underlying these changes have remained elusive. Here, we show that prolonged impairment of meningeal lymphatics alters the balance of cortical excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, accompanied by deficits in memory tasks. These synaptic and behavioral alterations induced by lymphatic dysfunction are mediated by microglia, leading to increased expression of the interleukin 6 gene (Il6). IL-6 drives inhibitory synapse phenotypes via a combination of trans- and classical IL-6 signaling. Restoring meningeal lymphatic function in aged mice reverses age-associated synaptic and behavioral alterations. Our findings suggest that dysfunctional meningeal lymphatics adversely impact cortical circuitry through an IL-6-dependent mechanism and identify a potential target for treating aging-associated cognitive decline.

Phaphuangwittayakul A, Harnpornchai N, Ying F, Zhang J	Railway track defects pose significant safety risks and can lead to accidents, economic losses, and loss of life. Traditional manual inspection methods are either time-consuming, costly, or prone to human error. This paper proposes RailTrack-DaViT, a novel vision transformer-based approach for railway track defect classification. By leveraging the Dual Attention Vision Transformer (DaViT) architecture, RailTrack-DaViT effectively captures both global and local information, enabling accurate defect detection. The model is trained and evaluated on multiple datasets including rail, fastener and fishplate, multi-faults, and ThaiRailTrack. A comprehensive analysis of the model's performance is provided including confusion matrices, training visualizations, and classification metrics. RailTrack-DaViT demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based methods, achieving the highest accuracies: 96.9% on the rail dataset, 98.9% on the fastener and fishplate dataset, and 98.8% on the multi-faults dataset. Moreover, RailTrack-DaViT outperforms baselines on the ThaiRailTrack dataset with 99.2% accuracy, quickly adapts to unseen images, and shows better model stability during fine-tuning. This capability can significantly reduce time consumption when applying the model to novel datasets in practical applications.

Corre J, Vincent L, Moreau P, Hebraud B, Hulin C, Béné MC, Broijl A, Caillot D, Delforge M, Dejoie T, Facon T, Lambert J, Leleu X, Macro M Dr, Perrot A, Zweegman S, Filleron T, Cabarrou B, van de Donk NWCJ, Mahéo S, Hua W, Wang J, Krevvata M, Vanquickelberghe V, de Boer C, Tuozzo A, Borgsten F, Rowe M, Carson R, Wuilleme S, Sonneveld P	Previous results from CASSIOPEIA (NCT02541383) demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity with the addition of daratumumab to bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTd) induction/consolidation and with daratumumab maintenance versus observation in transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). Here, we present long-term MRD status and PFS outcomes after an 80.1-month median follow-up. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to daratumumab plus VTd (D-VTd) or VTd induction/consolidation; patients remaining on study were re-randomized to daratumumab maintenance or observation for £2 years. MRD status was assessed at pre-defined timepoints during each study phase. D-VTd improved overall MRD-negativity rates (10-5) post-induction (34.6% vs 23.1%; P<0.0001) and post-consolidation (63.7% vs 43.7%; P<0.0001) and provided PFS benefit, regardless of post-induction MRD status, versus VTd alone. Daratumumab maintenance improved overall MRD-negativity rates over observation, regardless of induction/consolidation treatment (D-VTd/daratumumab vs D-VTd/observation: 10-5, 77.3% vs 70.7% [P=0.0417]; 10-6, 60.7% vs 52.0% [P=0.0365]; VTd/daratumumab vs VTd/observation: 10-5, 70.9% vs 51.2% [P<0.0001]; 10-6, 48.4% vs 30.7% [P<0.0001]), and improved MRD-negativity rates, regardless of risk status, as defined by cytogenetic abnormalities or revised International Staging System score. Further, daratumumab maintenance provided PFS benefit versus observation, regardless of induction/consolidation treatment and post-consolidation MRD status. D-VTd followed by daratumumab maintenance consistently produced the highest landmark, accumulative, and sustained MRD-negativity rates (10-5 and 10-6), translating to superior long-term PFS outcomes. These results demonstrate that daratumumab-based induction/consolidation followed by daratumumab maintenance resulted in the deepest and most durable MRD negativity, leading to superior PFS outcomes.

10.3390/jimaging10090227	Leveraging Perspective Transformation for Enhanced Pothole Detection in Autonomous Vehicles.	Abu-Raddaha A, El-Shair ZA, Rawashdeh S	Road conditions, often degraded by insufficient maintenance or adverse weather, significantly contribute to accidents, exacerbated by the limited human reaction time to sudden hazards like potholes. Early detection of distant potholes is crucial for timely corrective actions, such as reducing speed or avoiding obstacles, to mitigate vehicle damage and accidents. This paper introduces a novel approach that utilizes perspective transformation to enhance pothole detection at different distances, focusing particularly on distant potholes. Perspective transformation improves the visibility and clarity of potholes by virtually bringing them closer and enlarging their features, which is particularly beneficial given the fixed-size input requirement of object detection networks, typically significantly smaller than the raw image resolutions captured by cameras. Our method automatically identifies the region of interest (ROI)-the road area-and calculates the corner points to generate a perspective transformation matrix. This matrix is applied to all images and corresponding bounding box labels, enhancing the representation of potholes in the dataset. This approach significantly boosts detection performance when used with YOLOv5-small, achieving a 43% improvement in the average precision (AP) metric at intersection-over-union thresholds of 0.5 to 0.95 for single class evaluation, and notable improvements of 34%, 63%, and 194% for near, medium, and far potholes, respectively, after categorizing them based on their distance. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to employ perspective transformation specifically for enhancing the detection of distant potholes.

10.3390/jimaging10080197	A Multi-Scale Target Detection Method Using an Improved Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network Based on Enhanced Backbone and Optimized Mechanisms.	Chen Q, Li M, Lai Z, Zhu J, Guan L	Currently, existing deep learning methods exhibit many limitations in multi-target detection, such as low accuracy and high rates of false detection and missed detections. This paper proposes an improved Faster R-CNN algorithm, aiming to enhance the algorithm's capability in detecting multi-scale targets. This algorithm has three improvements based on Faster R-CNN. Firstly, the new algorithm uses the ResNet101 network for feature extraction of the detection image, which achieves stronger feature extraction capabilities. Secondly, the new algorithm integrates Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM), Soft non-maximum suppression (Soft-NMS), and Distance Intersection Over Union (DIOU) modules, which improves the positive and negative sample imbalance and the problem of small targets being easily missed during model training. Finally, the Region Proposal Network (RPN) is simplified to achieve a faster detection speed and a lower miss rate. The multi-scale training (MST) strategy is also used to train the improved Faster R-CNN to achieve a balance between detection accuracy and efficiency. Compared to the other detection models, the improved Faster R-CNN demonstrates significant advantages in terms of mAP@0.5, F1-score, and Log average miss rate (LAMR). The model proposed in this paper provides valuable insights and inspiration for many fields, such as smart agriculture, medical diagnosis, and face recognition.

Swarna RA, Hossain MM, Khatun MR, Rahman MM, Munir A	Scientific knowledge of image-based crack detection methods is limited in understanding their performance across diverse crack sizes, types, and environmental conditions. Builders and engineers often face difficulties with image resolution, detecting fine cracks, and differentiating between structural and non-structural issues. Enhanced algorithms and analysis techniques are needed for more accurate assessments. Hence, this research aims to generate an intelligent scheme that can recognize the presence of cracks and visualize the percentage of cracks from an image along with an explanation. The proposed method fuses features from concrete surface images through a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) and curvelet transform handcrafted (HC) method, optimized by linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) classifier then uses these features to recognize cracks. This study evaluates several CNN models, including VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception-V3, and ResNet-50, and various HC techniques, such as wavelet transform, counterlet transform, and curvelet transform for feature extraction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and LDA are assessed for feature optimization. For classification, XGB, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and category boosting (CatBoost) are tested. To isolate and quantify the crack region, this research combines image thresholding, morphological operations, and contour detection with the convex hulls method and forms a novel algorithm. Two explainable AI (XAI) tools, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIMEs) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping++ (Grad-CAM++) are integrated with the proposed method to enhance result clarity. This research introduces a novel feature fusion approach that enhances crack detection accuracy and interpretability. The method demonstrates superior performance by achieving 99.93% and 99.69% accuracy on two existing datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the development of an algorithm for isolating and quantifying crack regions represents a significant advancement in image processing for structural analysis. The proposed approach provides a robust and reliable tool for real-time crack detection and assessment in concrete structures, facilitating timely maintenance and improving structural safety. By offering detailed explanations of the model's decisions, the research addresses the critical need for transparency in AI applications, thus increasing trust and adoption in engineering practice.

10.3390/jimaging10090208	Task-Adaptive Angle Selection for Computed Tomography-Based Defect Detection.	Wang T, Florian V, Schielein R, Kretzer C, Kasperl S, Lucka F, van Leeuwen T	Sparse-angle X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) plays a vital role in industrial quality control but leads to an inherent trade-off between scan time and reconstruction quality. Adaptive angle selection strategies try to improve upon this based on the idea that the geometry of the object under investigation leads to an uneven distribution of the information content over the projection angles. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as an effective approach for adaptive angle selection in X-ray CT. While previous studies focused on optimizing generic image quality measures using a fixed number of angles, our work extends them by considering a specific downstream task, namely image-based defect detection, and introducing flexibility in the number of angles used. By leveraging prior knowledge about typical defect characteristics, our task-adaptive angle selection method, adaptable in terms of angle count, enables easy detection of defects in the reconstructed images.

Using data from 48,800 IBD-free participants in the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP), we assessed associations between 2923 plasma proteins and incident IBD risk using Cox analysis. Mendelian randomization (MR) meta-analysis, integrating cis-protein quantitative trait loci data from the UKB-PPP with IBD genome-wide association study data from the International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium and FinnGen studies, identified causal proteins. Colocalization analysis strengthened evidence of shared common causal variants. Cohort study revealed associations of 673, 295, and 125 proteins with the risk of IBD, Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC), respectively. MR and colocalization analyses prioritized IL12B, CD6, MXRA8, CXCL9, IFNG, CCN3, RSPO3, and IL18 as having causal and high colocalization evidence with IBD or its subtypes. Our findings advance understanding of IBD's molecular etiology and highlight potential therapeutic targets.

10.1038/s41586-025-08732-6	VDAC2 loss elicits tumour destruction and inflammation for cancer therapy.	Yuan S, Sun R, Shi H, Chapman NM, Hu H, Guy C, Rankin S, Kc A, Palacios G, Meng X, Sun X, Zhou P, Yang X, Gottschalk S, Chi H	Tumour cells often evade immune pressure exerted by CD8(+) T cells or immunotherapies through mechanisms that are largely unclear(1,2). Here, using complementary in vivo and in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screens to target metabolic factors, we established voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) as an immune signal-dependent checkpoint that curtails interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated tumour destruction and inflammatory reprogramming of the tumour microenvironment. Targeting VDAC2 in tumour cells enabled IFNγ-induced cell death and cGAS-STING activation, and markedly improved anti-tumour effects and immunotherapeutic responses. Using a genome-scale genetic interaction screen, we identified BAK as the mediator of VDAC2-deficiency-induced effects. Mechanistically, IFNγ stimulation increased BIM, BID and BAK expression, with VDAC2 deficiency eliciting uncontrolled IFNγ-induced BAK activation and mitochondrial damage. Consequently, mitochondrial DNA was aberrantly released into the cytosol and triggered robust activation of cGAS-STING signalling and type I IFN response. Importantly, co-deletion of STING signalling components dampened the therapeutic effects of VDAC2 depletion in tumour cells, suggesting that targeting VDAC2 integrates CD8(+) T cell- and IFNγ-mediated adaptive immunity with a tumour-intrinsic innate immune-like response. Together, our findings reveal VDAC2 as a dual-action target to overcome tumour immune evasion and establish the importance of coordinately destructing and inflaming tumours to enable efficacious cancer immunotherapy.

10.1016/S0140-6736(24)02840-X	Global, regional, and national burden of household air pollution, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.		BACKGROUND: Despite a substantial reduction in the use of solid fuels for cooking worldwide, exposure to household air pollution (HAP) remains a leading global risk factor, contributing considerably to the burden of disease. We present a comprehensive analysis of spatial patterns and temporal trends in exposure and attributable disease from 1990 to 2021, featuring substantial methodological updates compared with previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, including improved exposure estimations accounting for specific fuel types. METHODS: We estimated HAP exposure and trends and attributable burden for cataract, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, tracheal cancer, bronchus cancer, lung cancer, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and causes mediated via adverse reproductive outcomes for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We first estimated the mean fuel type-specific concentrations (in μg/m(3)) of fine particulate matter (PM(2·5)) pollution to which individuals using solid fuels for cooking were exposed, categorised by fuel type, location, year, age, and sex. Using a systematic review of the epidemiological literature and a newly developed meta-regression tool (meta-regression: Bayesian, regularised, trimmed), we derived disease-specific, non-parametric exposure-response curves to estimate relative risk as a function of PM(2·5) concentration. We combined our exposure estimates and relative risks to estimate population attributable fractions and attributable burden for each cause by sex, age, location, and year. FINDINGS: In 2021, 2·67 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2·63-2·71) people, 33·8% (95% UI 33·2-34·3) of the global population, were exposed to HAP from all sources at a mean concentration of 84·2 μg/m(3). Although these figures show a notable reduction in the percentage of the global population exposed in 1990 (56·7%, 56·4-57·1), in absolute terms, there has been only a decline of 0·35 billion (10%) from the 3·02 billion people exposed to HAP in 1990. In 2021, 111 million (95% UI 75·1-164) global disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were attributable to HAP, accounting for 3·9% (95% UI 2·6-5·7) of all DALYs. The rate of global, HAP-attributable DALYs in 2021 was 1500·3 (95% UI 1028·4-2195·6) age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population, a decline of 63·8% since 1990, when HAP-attributable DALYs comprised 4147·7 (3101·4-5104·6) age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population. HAP-attributable burden remained highest in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, with 4044·1 (3103·4-5219·7) and 3213·5 (2165·4-4409·4) age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population, respectively. The rate of HAP-attributable DALYs was higher for males (1530·5, 1023·4-2263·6) than for females (1318·5, 866·1-1977·2). Approximately one-third of the HAP-attributable burden (518·1, 410·1-641·7) was mediated via short gestation and low birthweight. Decomposition of trends and drivers behind changes in the HAP-attributable burden highlighted that declines in exposures were counteracted by population growth in most regions of the world, especially sub-Saharan Africa. INTERPRETATION: Although the burden attributable to HAP has decreased considerably, HAP remains a substantial risk factor, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Our comprehensive estimates of HAP exposure and attributable burden offer a robust and reliable resource for health policy makers and practitioners to precisely target and tailor health interventions. Given the persistent and substantial impact of HAP in many regions and countries, it is imperative to accelerate efforts to transition under-resourced communities to cleaner household energy sources. Such initiatives are crucial for mitigating health risks and promoting sustainable development, ultimately improving the quality of life and health outcomes for millions of people.

Here, LAG3 was found to undergo robust non-K48-linked polyubiquitination upon ligand engagement, which promotes LAG3's inhibitory function instead of causing degradation. This ubiquitination could be triggered by the engagement of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) and membrane-bound (but not soluble) fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1). LAG3 ubiquitination, mediated redundantly by the E3 ligases c-Cbl and Cbl-b, disrupted the membrane binding of the juxtamembrane basic residue-rich sequence, thereby stabilizing the LAG3 cytoplasmic tail in a membrane-dissociated conformation enabling signaling. Furthermore, LAG3 ubiquitination is crucial for the LAG3-mediated suppression of antitumor immunity in vivo. Consistently, LAG3 therapeutic antibodies repress LAG3 ubiquitination, correlating with their checkpoint blockade effects. Moreover, patient cohort analyses suggest that LAG3/CBL coexpression could serve as a biomarker for response to LAG3 blockade. Collectively, our study reveals an immune-checkpoint-triggering mechanism with translational potential in cancer immunotherapy.

Hu Y, Lu S, Xue C, Hu Z, Wang Y, Zhang W, Wang D, Wang J, Ding G, Yu J, Hu Y, Liu Y	BACKGROUND: The impact of metformin on sarcopenia remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate whether metformin influences sarcopenia risk and evaluate the effects of potential drug targets on sarcopenia traits. METHODS: We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (n = 3549) to assess the association between metformin use and sarcopenia risk in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from UK Biobank (n = 1,366,167) and FinnGen (n = 218,007), with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) as instrumental variables, examined the causal effect of metformin-related targets on sarcopenia traits, while molecular docking explored the interaction between metformin and its drug targets. RESULTS: Metformin use was associated with increased grip strength (OR = 2.46; 95% CI 1.49-2.38) and skeletal muscle mass (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 0.20-2.28), as well as reduced mortality (HR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.54-0.71). MR analysis suggested a possible link between GDF15 gene expression and sarcopenia traits, with no evidence of genetic confounding. Molecular docking indicated stable binding between metformin and GDF15. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that metformin may lower sarcopenia risk, particularly in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes, with GDF15 identified as a promising target for sarcopenia treatment.

Oncolytic viruses selectively replicate in and lyse cancer cells, releasing neoantigens and stimulating systemic antitumour immunity(3), offering a potential therapeutic option. Here we present the results of a multicentre phase 1 clinical trial evaluating VG161, an engineered oncolytic herpes simplex virus that expresses IL-12, IL-15, IL-15Rα and a PD-1-PD-L1-blocking fusion protein(4), for safety and efficacy in patients with advanced liver cancer. VG161 was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed, and it demonstrated promising efficacy by reshaping the tumour immune microenvironment and re-sensitizing tumours that were previously resistant to systemic treatments. Notably, we also found that patients who had previously been sensitive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy showed enhanced efficacy with VG161 treatment. Furthermore, we developed an efficacy-prediction model based on differentially expressed genes, which successfully identified patients who were likely to benefit from VG161 and predicted prolonged overall survival. These findings position VG161 as a promising third-line therapeutic option for refractory hepatocellular carcinoma. This provides a new avenue for treatment and advances the field of oncolytic virus-based immunotherapies. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04806464 .

Li W, Dasgupta A, Yang K, Wang S, Hemandhar-Kumar N, Chepyala SR, Yarbro JM, Hu Z, Salovska B, Fornasiero EF, Peng J, Liu Y	Understanding how proteins in different mammalian tissues are regulated is central to biology. Protein abundance, turnover, and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are key factors that determine tissue-specific proteome properties. However, these properties are challenging to study across tissues and remain poorly understood. Here, we present Turnover-PPT, a comprehensive resource mapping the abundance and lifetime of 11,000 proteins and 40,000 phosphosites in eight mouse tissues and various brain regions using advanced proteomics and stable isotope labeling. We reveal tissue-specific short- and long-lived proteins, strong correlations between interacting protein lifetimes, and distinct impacts of phosphorylation on protein turnover. Notably, we discover a remarkable pattern of turnover changes for peroxisome proteins in specific tissues and that phosphorylation regulates the stability of neurodegeneration-related proteins, such as Tau and α-synuclein. Thus, Turnover-PPT provides fundamental insights into protein stability, tissue dynamic proteotypes, and functional protein phosphorylation and is accessible via an interactive web-based portal at https://yslproteomics.shinyapps.io/tissuePPT.

OBJECTIVE: To compare microultrasonography-guided and MRI fusion-guided biopsy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter, international, open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial of biopsy-naive men from 20 centers (8 countries) with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (elevated prostate-specific antigen [PSA] and/or abnormal digital rectal examination findings) from December 2021 to September 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were assigned to receive either microultrasonography-guided biopsy (n = 121), microultrasonography/MRI fusion-guided biopsy (microultrasonography/MRI; n = 226, in which microultrasonography biopsies were performed prior to unblinding the MRI), or MRI/conventional US fusion-guided biopsy (MRI/conventional ultrasonography; n = 331). All participants received synchronous systematic biopsy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the difference in detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancers using microultrasonography plus systematic biopsy vs MRI/conventional ultrasonography plus systematic biopsy. The secondary outcome was the difference in detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancers found using microultrasonography/MRI plus systematic biopsy vs MRI/conventional ultrasonography plus systematic biopsy. The noninferiority margin was set at 10%. RESULTS: A total of 802 men underwent randomization and 678 underwent biopsy. Median (IQR) age was 65 (59-70) years and prostate-specific antigen level was 6.9 (5.2-9.8) ng/mL; 83% self-identified as White. Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancer was detected in 57 participants (47.1%) in the microultrasonography group, in 141 (42.6%) in the MRI/conventional ultrasonography group, and in 106 (46.9%) in the microultrasonography/MRI group. Microultrasonography-guided biopsy was noninferior to MRI fusion-guided biopsy (difference, 3.52% [95% CI, -3.95% to 10.92%]; noninferiority P < .001). Combined biopsy with microultrasonography/MRI was also noninferior to MRI/conventional ultrasonography software-assisted MRI fusion biopsy using conventional ultrasonography devices (difference, 4.29% [95% CI, -4.06% to 12.63%]; noninferiority P < .001). The rate of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancer diagnosed by targeted biopsy only was 38.0% in the microultrasonography group, 34.1% in the MRI/conventional ultrasonography group, and 40.3% in the microultrasonography/MRI group; these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The use of microultrasonography-guided biopsy was noninferior to MRI/conventional ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy for the detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher prostate cancer in biopsy-naive men.

If microorganisms overcome those barriers, however, innate immune cells use toxic chemicals to kill the invading cells(2,3). Here we examine immune diversity across tissues and identify a population of neutrophils in the skin that expresses a broad repertoire of proteins and enzymes needed to build the extracellular matrix. In the naive skin, these matrix-producing neutrophils contribute to the composition and structure of the extracellular matrix, reinforce its mechanical properties and promote barrier function. After injury, these neutrophils build 'rings' of matrix around wounds, which shield against foreign molecules and bacteria. This structural program relies on TGFβ signalling; disabling the TGFβ receptor in neutrophils impaired ring formation around wounds and facilitated bacterial invasion. We infer that the innate immune system has evolved diverse strategies for defence, including one that physically shields the host from the outside world.

Chen J, Xiang J, Zhou M, Huang R, Zhang J, Cui Y, Jiang X, Li Y, Zhou R, Xin H, Li J, Li L, Lam SM, Zhu J, Chen Y, Yang Q, Xie Z, Shui G, Deng F, Zhang Z, Li MD	Feeding rhythms regulate exercise performance and muscle energy metabolism. However, the mechanisms regulating adipocyte functions remain unclear. Here, using multi-omics analyses, involving (phospho-)proteomics and lipidomics, we found that day-restricted feeding (DRF) regulates diurnal rhythms of the mitochondrial proteome, neutral lipidome, and nutrient-sensing pathways in mouse gonadal white adipose tissue (GWAT). Adipocyte-specific knockdown of Prkaa2 (the gene encoding AMPKα2) impairs physical endurance. This defect is associated with altered rhythmicity in acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) metabolism-related genes, a loss of rhythmicity in the GWAT lipidome, and circadian remodeling of serum metabolites-in particular, lactate and succinate. We also found that adipocyte Prkaa2 regulates muscle clock genes during DRF. Notably, oral administration of the AMPK activator C29 increases endurance and muscle functions in a time-of-day manner, which requires intact adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling. Collectively, our work defines adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling as a critical regulator of circadian metabolic coordination between fat and muscle, thereby enhancing exercise performance.

In this study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive description of the phenotypic expression, natural history, and clinical outcomes of patients with this ARVC subset. METHODS: Genetic and clinical data of DSG2 and DSC2 variant carriers were collected from 5 countries in Europe and Asia. We assessed the phenotypic profile of these patients and their clinical outcomes, focusing on heart failure and ventricular arrhythmia events. RESULTS: Overall, 271 subjects, 254 with DSG2 variants, were included in this study (median age, 38 years [interquartile range, 25-52]; 62.7% male). Of these, 165 were probands, and 200 were diagnosed with definite ARVC. A total of 181 (66.8%) individuals carried missense variants, mainly distributed in the extracellular domains. Notably, we included 78 (28.8%) individuals with multiple variants. Of the 200 cases with diagnosed ARVC, 41 (20.5%) experienced premature cardiac death before the age of 65. Among the 81 individuals for whom both left ventricular ejection fraction and right ventricular fractional area change data were available at presentation, 29 (35.8%) had isolated right ventricular dysfunction, and 16 (19.8%) had biventricular dysfunction. Single-variant carriers who engaged in intense physical exercise were younger at disease onset compared with those who did not (P=0.001). Compared with single-variant carriers, those with multiple variants were more likely to be diagnosed with ARVC (96.2% versus 64.8%; P<0.001) and exhibited more severe left ventricular dysfunction (44.4% versus 22.1%; P=0.001) and right ventricular dilation (88.9% versus 55.8%, P<0.001). Multiple-variant carriers were significantly younger at ARVC diagnosis compared with single-variant carriers (33 [18-49] years versus 42 [27-54] years; P<0.001]. During follow-up, end-stage heart failure (P<0.001) and malignant ventricular arrhythmias (P=0.004) were significantly more frequent in multiple-variant compared with single-variant carriers. Compared with PKP2 patients, DSG2/DSC2 patients exhibited a significantly higher risk of end-stage heart failure (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ARVC attributable to variants in desmosomal cadherins mostly present with right ventricular or biventricular disease. Multiple variants are common in these patients and are associated with more frequent clinical penetrance, earlier onset of disease, and adverse clinical outcomes.

Tang M, Tu Y, Gong Y, Yang Q, Wang J, Zhang Z, Qin J, Niu S, Yi J, Shang Z, Chen H, Tang Y, Huang Q, Liu Y, Billadeau DD, Liu X, Dai L, Jia D	Mitochondrial dynamics and metabolites reciprocally influence each other. Mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) transport damaged mitochondrial components to lysosomes or the extracellular space. While many metabolites are known to modulate mitochondrial dynamics, it is largely unclear whether they are involved in MDV generation. Here, we discovered that the major component of ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), improved mitochondrial functions by facilitating the biogenesis of MDVs. Mechanistically, BHB drove specific lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) of sorting nexin-9 (SNX9), a key regulator of MDV biogenesis. Kbhb increased SNX9 interaction with inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM)/matrix proteins and promoted the formation of IMM/matrix MDVs. SNX9 Kbhb was not only critical for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in cells but also protected mice from alcohol-induced liver injury. Altogether, our research uncovers the fact that metabolites influence the formation of MDVs by directly engaging in post-translational modifications of key protein machineries and establishes a framework for understanding how metabolites regulate mitochondrial functions.

Li Y, Wang J, Zhou L, Gu W, Qin L, Peng D, Li S, Zheng D, Wu Q, Long Y, Yao Y, Lin S, Sun M, Zhang X, Wang J, Liu P, Kong X, Li P	Inactivation of the transcription factor BCL11B reprograms T cells into induced-T-to-NK cells (ITNKs). However, it remains unclear how BCL11B suppresses natural killer (NK) cell transcriptional programs. Here, we identified that the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 physically interacts with BCL11B, increasing BCL11B stability and the fidelity of DNA methylation maintenance for NK cell-related genes, thereby repressing their expression. Moreover, DNMT1 maintains the epigenetic silencing of a distinct subset of NK cell-related genes independent of BCL11B. DNMT1 inhibition or depletion reprograms T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells into NK-like cells that exhibit more robust antitumor effects than BCL11B-deficient ITNKs and parental CAR-T cells. Moreover, H3K27me3 (trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27) synergizes with DNA methylation to repress NK cell-related pathways, and combined EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) and DNMT1 inhibition potentiates both the reprogramming and cytotoxicity of NK-like cells. Our findings uncover the molecular mechanisms that safeguard T cell identity and provide a rationale for deriving NK-like cells with epigenetic inhibitors for cancer immunotherapy.

The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) is an ongoing platform trial assessing the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational products in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). Based on findings of amyloid removal and downstream biological effects from the gantenerumab group of the platform trial, we continued a 3-year open-label extension (OLE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with high doses of gantenerumab. METHODS: The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 multi-arm trial (DIAN-TU-001) assessed solanezumab or gantenerumab versus placebo in participants who were between 15 years before and 10 years after their estimated years to symptom onset and who had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0 (cognitively normal) to 1 (mild dementia). This study was followed by an OLE study of gantenerumab treatment, conducted at 18 study sites in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Spain, the UK, and the USA. For inclusion in the OLE, participants at risk for DIAD had participated in the double-blind period of DIAN-TU-001 and were required to know their mutation status. We investigated increasing doses of subcutaneous gantenerumab up to 1500 mg every 2 weeks. Due to the lack of a regulatory path for gantenerumab, the study was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis (when most participants had completed 2 years of treatment) of the clinical measure CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). The primary outcome for the final analysis was the amyloid plaque measure (11)C-Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR [PiB-PET SUVR]) at 3 years, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat group (mITT; defined as participants who received any gantenerumab treatment post-OLE baseline, had at least one PiB-PET SUVR assessment before gantenerumab treatment, and a post-baseline assessment). All participants who received at least one dose of study drug in the OLE were included in the safety analysis. DIAN-TU-001 (NCT01760005) and the OLE (NCT06424236) are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. FINDINGS: Of 74 participants who were recruited into the OLE study between June 3, 2020, and April 22, 2021, 73 were enrolled and received gantenerumab treatment. 47 (64%) stopped dosing due to early termination of the study by the sponsor, and 13 (18%) prematurely discontinued the study for other reasons; 13 people completed 3 years of treatment. The mITT group for the primary analysis comprised 55 participants. At the interim analysis, the hazard ratio for clinical decline of CDR-SB in asymptomatic mutation carriers was 0·79 (n=53 [95% CI 0·47 to 1·32]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab in either the double-blind or OLE period (Any Gant), and 0·53 (n=22 [0·27 to 1·03]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab the longest (Longest Gant). At the final analysis, the adjusted mean change from OLE baseline to year 3 in PiB-PET SUVR was -0·71 SUVR (95% CI -0·88 to -0·53, p<0·0001). Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities occurred in 53% (39 of 73) of participants: 47% (34 of 73) with microhaemorrhages, 30% (22 of 73) with oedema, and 6% (five of 73) were associated with superficial siderosis. No treatment-associated macrohaemorrhages or deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Partial or short-term amyloid removal did not show significant clinical effects. However, long-term full amyloid removal potentially delayed symptom onset and dementia progression. Our conclusions are limited due to the OLE design and use of external controls and need to be confirmed in long-term trials.

The unfolded protein response alleviating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress involves activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) that impedes translation by mRNA decay. We discover that the IRE1α digestion motif is present in insulin mRNA carrying SNP rs3842752 (G>A). This SNP in the 3' untranslated region of INS associates with protection from T1D (INS(P)). ER stress in beta cells with INS(P) led to accelerated insulin mRNA decay compared with the susceptible INS variant (INS(S)). Human islets with INS(P) showed improved vitality and function and reversed diabetes more rapidly when transplanted into diabetic mice than islets carrying INS(S) only. Surrogate beta cells with INS(P) expressed less ER stress and INS-DRiP neoantigen. This explanation for genetic protection from T1D may act instead of or in concert with the previously proposed mechanism attributed to INS promoter polymorphism.

Tang H, Huang J, Zhang X, Chen X, Yang Q, Luo N, Lin H, Hong J, Wu S, Tian C, Lin M, Tang J, Wen J, Chen P, Jiang L, Zhang Y, Yi K, Tan X, Chen Y	BACKGROUND: Although some studies have examined the association between the triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI) and cardiovascular outcomes in the cardio-renal-metabolic (CRM) background, none have explored its role in the progression of CRM multimorbidity. In addition, prior research is limited by small sample sizes and a failure to account for the competitive effects of other CRM diseases. METHODS: In this study, data obtained from the large-scale, prospective UK Biobank cohort were used. CRM multimorbidity was defined as the new-onset of ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease during follow-up. Multivariable Cox regression was used to analyse the independent association between TyG-BMI and each CRM multimorbidity (first, double, or triple CRM diseases). The C-statistic was calculated for each model, and a restricted cubic spline was applied to assess the dose-response relationship. A multi-state model was used to investigate the association between TyG-BMI and the trajectory of CRM multimorbidity (from baseline [without CRM disease] to the first CRM disease, the first CRM disease to double disease, and double disease to triple disease), with disease-specific analyses. RESULTS: This study included 349,974 participants, with a mean age of 56.05 (standard deviation [SD], 8.08), 55.93% of whom were female. Over a median follow-up of approximately 14 years, 56,659 (16.19%) participants without baseline CRM disease developed at least one CRM disease, including 8451 (14.92%) who progressed to double CRM disease and 789 (9.34%) who further developed triple CRM disease. In the crude model, each SD increase in TyG-BMI was associated with a 47% higher risk of the first CRM disease, a 72% higher risk of double CRM disease, and a 95% higher risk of triple CRM disease, with C-statistics of 0.625, 0.694, and 0.764, respectively. Multi-state model analysis showed a 32% increased risk of new CRM disease, a 24% increased risk of progression to double CRM disease, and a 23% increased risk of further progression for those with double CRM diseases. TyG-BMI was significantly associated with the onset of all individual first CRM diseases (except for stroke) and with the transition to double CRM disease. Significant interactions were also observed, but TyG-BMI remained significantly associated with CRM multimorbidity across subgroups. Sensitivity analyses, including varying time intervals for entering states and an expanded CRM definition (including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, obesity, and dyslipidaemia), confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: TyG-BMI remarkably influences the onset and progression of CRM multimorbidity. Incorporating it into CRM multimorbidity prevention and management could have important public health implications.

10.1016/j.ahj.2025.03.009	Association between vasopressin administration and mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock.	Sarma D, Smith R, Padkins M, Rali AS, Vallabhajosyula S, Khanna AK, Kashani K, Hibbert B, Jentzer JC	BACKGROUND: The utility of vasopressin as an adjunctive, catecholamine-sparing vasopressor in cardiogenic shock (CS) has not been widely examined. METHODS: We included consecutive adult patients admitted with a diagnosis of CS requiring vasopressors. High-dose vasopressors (HDV) were defined as ≥0.3 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine equivalent. Multivariable logistic regression and propensity analysis was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values for in-hospital mortality, before and after adjustment for relevant covariates. RESULTS: We included 721 CS patients, including HDV in 32.5%. Vasopressin was administered in 207 (29%) patients within the first 24 hours. In-hospital mortality occurred in 38.1% and was higher in the HDV group (56.8% vs. 29.2%). Vasopressin was associated with lower propensity adjusted in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.99, p = 0.05). Vasopressin use was also associated with lower mortality in the HDV group (unadjusted OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.92, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Vasopressin use in the first 24 hours was associated with lower adjusted mortality in patients with CS, particularly amongst those requiring HDV. The use of vasopressin in CS merits dedicated prospective evaluation.

10.1007/978-1-0716-3854-5_2	Using 3-Dimensional Cultures to Propagate Genetically Modified Lung Organoids.	Chen F, Naughton KJ, Lee JH, Brainson CF	Transformed lung organoids have extensive applications in lung cancer modeling and drug screening. Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures fail to propagate a large subpopulation of murine primary tumors in vitro. However, three-dimensional (3D) air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures, which are employed to grow normal lung organoids, can be used to efficiently culture cancerous lung tumor cells. Here, we detail a procedure for cultivating genetically modified lung organoids in 3D-ALI cultures. This protocol contains two parts. The first part describes how to transduce lung epithelial cells, which are either freshly sorted from lungs or from actively growing murine organoids, with virus in order to modify gene expression. The target lung cells are incubated with virus for 1-2 h for transduction. Then, the transduced cells are thoroughly washed and mixed with stromal support cells and Matrigel and are loaded into transwell inserts for culture and validated for genetic modifications through downstream assays. The second part describes how to isolate tumor cells growing orthotopically in genetically engineered mouse models to produce organoid cell lines that can be used for ex vivo drug discovery assays. For this protocol, tumors are isolated from lungs of mice, finely chopped and washed. Then, tumor chunks are mixed with Matrigel for 3D-ALI culture. Finally, organoids budding from tumor chunks are trypsinized and passaged to establish an organoid line. Together these two protocols provide a promising platform to study the genesis, progression, and treatment of lung cancer.

Inspired by the partial resistance to TGFβ of NK cells with SMAD4 haploinsufficiency, we used CRISPR-Cas9 for knockout of SMAD4 in human NK cells. Here we show that SMAD4(KO) NK cells were resistant to TGFβ and activin A inhibition, retaining their cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion and interleukin-2/interleukin-15-driven proliferation. They showed enhanced tumor penetration and tumor growth control, both as monotherapy and in combination with tumor-targeted therapeutic antibodies. Notably, SMAD4(KO) NK cells outperformed control NK cells treated with a TGFβ inhibitor, underscoring the benefit of maintaining SMAD4-independent TGFβ signaling. SMAD4(KO) conferred TGFβ resistance across diverse NK cell platforms, including CD19-CAR NK cells, stem cell-derived NK cells and ADAPT-NK cells. These findings position SMAD4 knockout as a versatile and compelling strategy to enhance NK cell antitumor activity, providing a new avenue for improving NK cell-based cancer immunotherapies.

Zhao Y, Gao L, Chen J, Wei J, Lin G, Hu K, Zhao W, Wei W, Huang W, Gao L, Yuan A, Qian K, Chen AF, Pu J	Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is an advanced form of liver disease with adverse outcomes. Manipulating interorgan communication is considered a promising strategy for managing metabolic disease, including steatohepatitis. Here, we report that remote limb ischemic conditioning (RIC), a clinically validated therapy for distant organ protection by transient muscle ischemia, significantly alleviated steatohepatitis in different mouse models. The beneficial effect of limb ischemic conditioning was mediated by muscle-to-liver transfer of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and their cargo microRNAs, leading to elevation of miR-181d-5p in the liver. Hepatic miR-181d-5p overexpression faithfully mirrored the molecular and histological benefits of limb ischemic conditioning by suppressing nuclear receptor 4A3 (NR4A3). Furthermore, circulating EVs from human volunteers undergoing limb ischemic conditioning improved steatohepatitis and transcriptomic perturbations in primary human hepatocytes and animal models. Our data underscore the translational potential of limb ischemic conditioning for steatohepatitis management and extend our understanding of muscle-liver crosstalk.

10.2337/dc24-2535	Association Between Diabetes and Anemia: Evidence From NHANES and the UK Biobank.	Wang D, Morton JI, Salim A, Shaw JE, Magliano DJ	OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between diabetes and anemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We included 9,026 and 389,616 participants from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and the UK Biobank study (UKB), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the cross-sectional association of diabetes with anemia, as defined by hemoglobin measurement. For the UKB follow-up, multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of incident anemia, as defined by hemoglobin levels or diagnosis records, in relation to diabetes. We further assessed the impact of inflammation, renal dysfunction, and medication use on this association in both populations. RESULTS: Among White people aged 40-69 years in the U.S. and U.K., the adjusted odds of study participants with diagnosed diabetes also having anemia was two to four times higher than in those with normal glycemia. Over a median follow-up of 13.6 years in the UKB, 42,354 people developed anemia. The adjusted HRs for incident anemia comparing diagnosed diabetes with normal glycemia were 3.05 (95% CI 2.90-3.21) for iron deficiency anemia, 3.02 (95% CI 2.51-3.63) for anemia of chronic disease, and 4.88 (95% CI 4.23-5.63) for vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. Further adjustment for inflammation, renal dysfunction, and medication use partially attenuated these associations, but they remained strong and significant. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes was associated with several major types of anemia. Further studies are warranted to identify the mechanisms.

Our research reveals that dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT), a pyruvate metabolism enzyme, promotes leucine accumulation and sustains mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex activation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mechanistically, DLAT directly acetylates the K109 residue of AU RNA-binding methylglutaconyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydratase (AUH), a critical enzyme in leucine catabolism, inhibiting its activity and leading to leucine accumulation. Notably, DLAT upregulation correlates with poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Therefore, we developed an AUH(K109R)-mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) therapeutic strategy, which effectively inhibits tumor growth by restoring leucine catabolism and inhibiting mTOR activation in vivo. In summary, our findings uncover DLAT's unexpected role as an acetyltransferase for AUH, suppressing leucine catabolism. Restoring leucine catabolism with AUH(K109R)-mRNA LNP effectively inhibits HCC development, highlighting a novel direction for cancer research.

10.1016/S2468-2667(25)00044-1	Three decades of population health changes in Japan, 1990-2021: a subnational analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.		BACKGROUND: Given Japan's rapidly ageing demographic structure, comprehensive and long-term evaluations of its national and subnational health progress are important to inform public health policy. This study aims to assess Japan's population health, using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 to analyse the country's evolving disease patterns. METHODS: GBD 2021 used Japanese data from 1474 sources, covering 371 diseases, including COVID-19, and 88 risk factors. The analysis included estimates of life expectancy, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Estimates were generated using the standardised GBD methodology, which incorporates various data sources through statistical modelling, including the Cause Of Death Ensemble Model for mortality, Bayesian Meta-Regression Disease Model for non-fatal outcomes, and risk factor estimation frameworks to quantify attributable burdens. Life expectancy decomposition by cause of death and annualised rates of change of age-standardised mortality and DALYs were calculated for 1990-2005, 2005-15, and 2015-21. FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2021, life expectancy in Japan rose from 79·4 years (95% uncertainty interval 79·3-79·4) to 85·2 years (85·1-85·2), with prefecture-level disparities widening. Gains were primarily driven by reduced mortality from stroke (adding 1·5 years to life expectancy), ischaemic heart disease (1·0 years), and neoplasms, particularly stomach cancer (0·5 years), with variation across prefectures. Leading causes of death in 2021 were Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (135·3 deaths [39·5-312·3] per 100 000 population), stroke (114·9 [89·8-129·3] per 100 000), ischaemic heart disease (96·5 [77·7-106·7] per 100 000), and lung cancer (72·1 [61·8-77·5] per 100 000). Age-standardised mortality for major non-communicable diseases declined, but the pace of this decline has slowed. All-cause annualised rate of change in mortality rate decreased from -1·6% for 2005-15 to -1·1% for 2015-21. Age-standardised COVID-19 mortality rates were 0·8 deaths (0·7-0·9) per 100 000 population (accounting for 0·3% of all deaths) in 2020 and 3·0 (2·5-3·7) per 100 000 population in 2021 (1·0% of deaths). Age-standardised DALY rates for diabetes worsened, with annualised rate of change increasing from 0·1% for 2005-15 to 2·2% for 2015-21. This change parallels worsening trends in major risk factors, particularly high fasting plasma glucose (annualised rate of change of attributable DALYs -0·8% for 2005-15 and 0·8% for 2015-21) and high BMI (0·2% and 1·4%, respectively). Age-standardised DALYs attributable to other major risk factors continued to decrease, albeit slower. INTERPRETATION: Japan's health gains over the past 30 years are now stalling, with rising regional disparities. The increasing burdens of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and diabetes, alongside high fasting plasma glucose and high BMI, highlight areas needing focused attention and action.

Age-standardised DALYs attributable to other major risk factors continued to decrease, albeit slower. INTERPRETATION: Japan's health gains over the past 30 years are now stalling, with rising regional disparities. The increasing burdens of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and diabetes, alongside high fasting plasma glucose and high BMI, highlight areas needing focused attention and action.

Eriksson G, Li C, Sparovec TG, Dekanski A, Torstensson S, Risal S, Ohlsson C, Hirschberg AL, Petropoulos S, Deng Q, Stener-Victorin E	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has a negative effect on the receptivity of the endometrium to embryo implantation and increases the risk of miscarriage and endometrial cancer. The cellular and molecular heterogeneity of the endometrium in women with PCOS has not been well studied. Our study presents a comprehensive cellular atlas of the endometrium during the proliferative phase in women with PCOS characterized by overweight and obesity, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance compared with controls of similar age, weight and body mass index. Analysis of 247,791 isolated endometrial nuclei from 27 biopsies (5 controls and 12 PCOS cases at baseline and 7 after 16 weeks of metformin and 3 after lifestyle intervention) revealed cell-type-specific disease signatures and variations in cellular composition and localization. Samples taken after 16 weeks of metformin treatment and lifestyle management showed extensive recovery of disease-specific endometrial signatures. We linked the specific role of each cell type to clinical features such as hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance, and specific cell types to risk of endometrial and metabolic disease. In addition, potential therapeutic targets such as integrin inhibitors were identified and the role of metformin in restoring endometrial health in patients with PCOS was highlighted. Our findings lay the groundwork to significantly advance the understanding of PCOS-specific endometrial dysfunction for future targeted therapies.

Here, we present the Asian Immune Diversity Atlas (AIDA), a multi-national single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) healthy reference atlas of human immune cells. AIDA comprises 1,265,624 circulating immune cells from 619 donors, spanning 7 population groups across 5 Asian countries, and 6 controls. Though population groups are frequently compared at the continental level, we found that sub-continental diversity, age, and sex pervasively impacted cellular and molecular properties of immune cells. These included differential abundance of cell neighborhoods as well as cell populations and genes relevant to disease risk, pathogenesis, and diagnostics. We discovered functional genetic variants influencing cell-type-specific gene expression, which were under-represented in non-Asian populations, and helped contextualize disease-associated variants. AIDA enables analyses of multi-ancestry disease datasets and facilitates the development of precision medicine efforts in Asia and beyond.	Cell	18/03/2025	Asian diversity in human immune cells..

10.1136/gutjnl-2024-333638	Endothelial-like cancer-associated fibroblasts facilitate pancreatic cancer metastasis via vasculogenic mimicry and paracrine signalling.	Sun X, Cai W, Li H, Gao C, Ma X, Guo Y, Fu D, Xiao D, Zhang Z, Wang Y, Yang S, Feng Y, Zhao T, Hao J	BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are highly heterogeneous in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and vasculogenic mimicry (VM) refers to a phenomenon in which cancer cells adopt endothelial-like characteristics. OBJECTIVE: To identify a novel protumoural CAF subtype undertaking VM. DESIGN: We used single-cell RNA sequencing and mIHC to identify FAPα(+)CD144(+) endothelial-like CAFs (endoCAFs) and combined prospective and retrospective analyses to assess its clinical outcomes. Tube formation, proliferation and invasion assay were conducted on cell lines, organoids, the orthotopic tumour model and LSL-Kras(G12D/+), LSL-Trp53(R172H/+) and Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mouse model. Mechanically, we performed cytokine array assays, RNA-sequencing, IP-mass spectrometry, ChIP and luciferase analyses. Importantly, an siRNA delivery nanosystem was developed to precisely target FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs in vivo. RESULTS: FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs were present in the tumour microenvironment of PDAC, and patients with a higher CD144(+)CAFs proportion displayed poor prognosis of PDAC. FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs not only acquired a VM phenotype to provide metastatic conduits but also promoted the proliferation and invasion of tumour cells in situ through paracrine signalling, thereby actively facilitating the metastasis of tumour cells. The CD144-β-catenin-STAT3 signalling axis was activated, and CD144 and downstream secreted cytokines were transcriptionally upregulated to maintain the dual roles of endoCAFs. A CAF-targeting siRNA delivery nanosystem, via loading FAPα and siCD144, was administered to precisely target FAPα(+)CD144(+) endoCAFs, which substantially inhibited their protumoural roles in vivo. CONCLUSION: FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs can promote metastasis of PDAC via undertaking VM and paracrine through activation of the CD144-β-catenin-STAT3 signalling axis. CAF-targeting siRNA delivery nanosystem can inhibit tumour progression by precisely targeting FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs.

Wang K, Ni B, Xie Y, Li Z, Yuan L, Meng C, Zhao T, Gao S, Huang C, Wang H, Ma Y, Zhou T, Feng Y, Chang A, Yang C, Yu J, Yu W, Zang F, Zhang Y, Ji RR, Wang X, Hao J	The emerging field of cancer neuroscience has demonstrated great progress in revealing the crucial role of the nervous system in cancer initiation and progression. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by perineural invasion and modulated by autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) and sensory innervations. Here, we further demonstrated that within the tumor microenvironment of PDAC, nociceptor neurons interacted with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) through calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and nerve growth factor (NGF). This interaction led to the inhibition of interleukin-15 expression in CAFs, suppressing the infiltration and cytotoxic function of natural killer (NK) cells and thereby promoting PDAC progression and cancer pain. In PDAC patients, nociceptive innervation of tumor tissue is negatively correlated with the infiltration of NK cells while positively correlated with pain intensity. This association serves as an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival and relapse-free survival for PDAC patients. Our findings highlight the crucial regulation of NK cells by nociceptor neurons through interaction with CAFs in the development of PDAC. We also propose that targeting nociceptor neurons or CGRP signaling may offer a promising therapy for PDAC and cancer pain.

Tang H, Huang J, Lin H, Zhang X, Yang Q, Luo N, Lin M, Tian C, Wu S, Hong J, Wen J, Jiang L, Chen P, Chen X, Tang J, Zhang Y, Yi K, Tan X, Chen Y	BACKGROUND: Understanding the evolving patterns of cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden attributable to ambient particulate matter pollution (APMP) is essential. Furthermore, research on the underlying mechanisms has mostly been limited to laboratory and animal models, with few large-scale population-based studies. METHODS: Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2021, we analyzed disability-adjusted life years and mortality for CVD attributable to APMP (measured as particulate matter [PM](2.5)) from 1990 to 2021. We examined shifts in burden between APMP and household air pollution (HAP), regional disparities by socio-demographic index (SDI), and predicted trends using a Bayesian age-period-cohort model. Additionally, we used UK Biobank (UKB) data (metabolomics: 230,000 + participants; proteomics: 50,000 +) to identify biomarkers mediating the association between PM(2.5) exposure and CVD outcomes, and further analyzed their biological roles. Metabolic and proteomic signatures were constructed using regression and elastic net models, with predictive performance assessed via time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis. Life expectancy was evaluated using flexible parametric survival models. Subgroup analysis was conducted by age, sex, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and genetic susceptibility. RESULTS: In 2021, the global CVD absolute burden attributable to APMP was more than double that of 1990, with significant regional disparities. The burden shifted from HAP to APMP, with 15% of CVD cases globally attributed to APMP. The CVD burden attributable to APMP increased with age and is projected to rise through 2030. In the UKB, approximately 30 metabolites, including albumin, mediated the association between PM(2.5) exposure and CVD outcomes, primarily involving lipid and fatty acids metabolism. Over 60 proteins, including growth differentiation factor-15 and trefoil factor 2, mediated the association with CVD outcomes, enriched in cytokine-receptor interaction and leukocyte migration pathways. Metabolic and proteomic signatures outperformed PM(2.5) alone in predicting 1-, 5-, and 10-year CVD outcomes. Participants in the lowest decile of PM(2.5) exposure, metabolic, and proteomic signatures had longer life expectancy than those in the highest decile. CONCLUSION: The CVD burden attributable to APMP remains a critical public health concern. This study presents a novel approach for identifying and managing susceptible populations through metabolomic and proteomic perspectives.

We used in situ cryo-electron tomography to visualize the native structures and organization of several major mitochondrial complexes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. ATP synthases and respiratory complexes segregate into curved and flat crista membrane domains, respectively. Respiratory complexes I, III, and IV assemble into a respirasome supercomplex, from which we determined a native 5-angstrom (Å) resolution structure showing binding of electron carrier cytochrome c.

We aimed to investigate whether active surveillance could be an alternative for individuals with a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in 12 Dutch hospitals. Individuals with locally advanced oesophageal cancer and a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (ie, no tumour detected with endoscopic biopsies, ultrasound, and PET-CT) underwent active surveillance or standard surgery (ie, oesophagectomy within 2 weeks after reaching clinical complete response). There were no inclusion restrictions regarding comorbidities or performance status, but participants had carcinoma, were age 18 years or older, and were treated with curative intent. Randomisation of hospitals was performed using computer-generated sequences without stratification methods, after an initial phase of all hospitals performing standard surgery. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed according to a modified intention-to-treat principle (allowing crossover at time of clinical complete response) and an intention-to-treat principle. Non-inferiority was defined as 2-year survival rate for active surveillance of 15% or less below that for standard surgery. The trial was registered within the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR-6803, and the inclusion phase has been completed. FINDINGS: Between Nov 8, 2017, and Jan 17, 2021, 1115 individuals were screened, of whom 309 were included. 198 underwent active surveillance and 111 underwent standard surgery. 242 (78%) participants were male and 67 (22%) were female. Median follow-up was 38 months (IQR 32-48). 2-year overall survival for active surveillance (74% [95% CI 69-78]) was non-inferior to standard surgery (71% [62-78]) after modified intention-to-treat analysis (one-sided 95% boundary: 7% lower). It remained non-inferior in the intention-to-treat analysis (75% [68-80] vs 70% [63-77], one-sided 95% boundary: 6% lower). There were no significant differences in overall survival according to modified intention-to-treat analysis (hazard ratio 1·14, two-sided 95% CI 0·74-1·78) or intention-to-treat analysis (0·83, 0·53-1·31). The frequency of postoperative complications and postoperative mortality after standard surgery or postponed surgery after active surveillance was similar between groups. INTERPRETATION: Overall survival after active surveillance for oesophageal cancer was non-inferior compared with standard surgery after 2 years. For the long-term efficacy of active surveillance, extended follow-up is required. The results of the present trial could be used for patient counselling and shared decision making. FUNDING: Dutch Cancer Society (KWF) and Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMw).	The Lancet. Oncology	17/03/2025	Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by active surveillance versus standard surgery for oesophageal cancer (SANO trial): a multicentre, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.. BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of individuals with oesophageal cancer have a pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and oesophagectomy. We aimed to investigate whether active surveillance could be an alternative for individuals with a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in 12 Dutch hospitals. Individuals with locally advanced oesophageal cancer and a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (ie, no tumour detected with endoscopic biopsies, ultrasound, and PET-CT) underwent active surveillance or standard surgery (ie, oesophagectomy within 2 weeks after reaching clinical complete response). There were no inclusion restrictions regarding comorbidities or performance status, but participants had carcinoma, were age 18 years or older, and were treated with curative intent. Randomisation of hospitals was performed using computer-generated sequences without stratification methods, after an initial phase of all hospitals performing standard surgery. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed according to a modified intention-to-treat principle (allowing crossover at time of clinical complete response) and an intention-to-treat principle. Non-inferiority was defined as 2-year survival rate for active surveillance of 15% or less below that for standard surgery. The trial was registered within the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR-6803, and the inclusion phase has been completed. FINDINGS: Between Nov 8, 2017, and Jan 17, 2021, 1115 individuals were screened, of whom 309 were included. 198 underwent active surveillance and 111 underwent standard surgery. 242 (78%) participants were male and 67 (22%) were female. Median follow-up was 38 months (IQR 32-48). 2-year overall survival for active surveillance (74% [95% CI 69-78]) was non-inferior to standard surgery (71% [62-78]) after modified intention-to-treat analysis (one-sided 95% boundary: 7% lower). It remained non-inferior in the intention-to-treat analysis (75% [68-80] vs 70% [63-77], one-sided 95% boundary: 6% lower). There were no significant differences in overall survival according to modified intention-to-treat analysis (hazard ratio 1·14, two-sided 95% CI 0·74-1·78) or intention-to-treat analysis (0·83, 0·53-1·31).

Li SJ, Zheng QW, Zheng J, Zhang JB, Liu H, Tie JJ, Zhang KL, Wu FF, Li XD, Zhang S, Sun X, Yang YL, Wang YY	Cerebellar ataxia is the primary manifestation of cerebellar degenerative diseases, and mitochondrial dysfunction in Purkinje cells (PCs) plays a critical role in disease progression. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of mitochondria transplantation as a potential therapeutic approach to rescue cerebellar neurodegeneration and elucidate the associated mechanisms. We constructed a conditional Drp1 knockout model in PCs (PCKO mice), characterized by progressive ataxia. Drp1 knockout resulted in pervasive and progressive apoptosis of PCs and significant activation of surrounding glial cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggers mitophagy, is a key pathogenic factor contributing to morphological and functional damage in PCs. Transplanting liver-derived mitochondria into the cerebellum of 1-month-old PCKO mice improved mitochondrial function, reduced mitophagy, delayed apoptosis of PCs, and alleviated cerebellar ataxia for up to 3 weeks. These findings demonstrate that mitochondria transplantation holds promise as a therapeutic approach for cerebellar degenerative diseases.

Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase renowned for mitochondrial quality control, has emerged as a regulator of immune response. Here, we show that both systemic and macrophage-specific ablations of Parkin in mice lead to attenuated tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. By single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Parkin deficiency reshapes the TIME through activating both innate and adaptive immunities to control tumor progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5-dependent autophagy. Furthermore, Parkin deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade treatment and Park2(-/-) signature aids in predicting the prognosis of patients with solid tumor.

Leveraging the Latino Colorectal Cancer Consortium (LC3) and other existing datasets, we analyzed whole exome sequencing data on tumor/normal pairs from 718 individuals with colorectal cancer to map somatic mutational features by ethnicity and genetic similarity. Global proportions of African, Asian, European, and Native American genetic ancestries were estimated using ADMIXTURE. Associations between these proportions and somatic mutational features were examined using logistic regression. APC, TP53, and KRAS were the top three mutated genes across all participants and in the subset of Latino individuals in LC3. In analyses examining recurrently mutated genes, tumors from patients of Latino ethnicity had fewer KRAS and PIK3CA mutations compared to tumors from non-Latino patients. Genetic ancestry overall was associated with CDC27 mutation status, and African genetic ancestry was associated with SMAD2 mutation status. In exome-wide analyses, African genetic ancestry was significantly associated with higher odds of mutation in KNCN and TMEM184B. Native American genetic ancestry was associated with a lower frequency of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. The SBS11 mutational signature was associated with Native American genetic ancestry as well as Latino ethnicity. In an independent replication dataset, MSK-IMPACT, estimates of association were largely consistent in direction, but non-significant. A meta-analysis of LC3 and MSK-IMPACT showed that African genetic ancestry was significantly associated with KRAS mutation status and MSI status.

Song L, Chen W, Hou J, Guo M, Yang J	Depicting spatial distributions of disease-relevant cells is crucial for understanding disease pathology(1,2). Here we present genetically informed spatial mapping of cells for complex traits (gsMap), a method that integrates spatial transcriptomics data with summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to map cells to human complex traits, including diseases, in a spatially resolved manner. Using embryonic spatial transcriptomics datasets covering 25 organs, we benchmarked gsMap through simulation and by corroborating known trait-associated cells or regions in various organs. Applying gsMap to brain spatial transcriptomics data, we reveal that the spatial distribution of glutamatergic neurons associated with schizophrenia more closely resembles that for cognitive traits than that for mood traits such as depression. The schizophrenia-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the dorsal hippocampus, with upregulated expression of calcium signalling and regulation genes, whereas depression-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the deep medial prefrontal cortex, with upregulated expression of neuroplasticity and psychiatric drug target genes. Our study provides a method for spatially resolved mapping of trait-associated cells and demonstrates the gain of biological insights (such as the spatial distribution of trait-relevant cells and related signature genes) through these maps.

Lagrange E, Loriot MA, Chaudhary NK, Schultz P, Dirks AC, Guissart C, James TY, Vernoux JP, Camu W, Tripathi A, Spencer PS	A case-control study of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a mountainous village in the French Alps discovered an association of cases with a history of eating wild fungi (false morels) collected locally and initially identified and erroneously reported as Gyromitra gigas. Specialist re-examination of dried specimens of the ALS-associated fungi demonstrated they were members of the G. esculenta group, namely G. venenata and G. esculenta, species that have been reported to contain substantially higher concentrations of gyromitrin than present in G. gigas. Gyromitrin is metabolized to monomethylhydrazine, which is responsible not only for the acute oral toxic and neurotoxic properties of false morels but also has genotoxic potential with proposed mechanistic relevance to the etiology of neurodegenerative disease. Most ALS patients had a slow- or intermediate-acetylator phenotype predicted by N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2) genotyping, which would increase the risk for neurotoxic and genotoxic effects of gyromitrin metabolites.	eNeurologicalSci	/06/2024	Corrected speciation and gyromitrin content of false morels linked to ALS patients with mostly slow-acetylator phenotypes..

Kunnuji M	Research has shown that in countries such as Nigeria many urban dwellers live in a state of squalour and lack the basic necessities of food, clothing and shelter. The present study set out to examine the association between forms of basic deprivation--such as food deprivation, high occupancy ratio as a form of shelter deprivation, and inadequate clothing--and two sexual outcomes--timing of onset of penetrative sex and involvement in multiple sexual partnerships. The study used survey data from a sample of 480 girls resident in Iwaya community. A survival analysis of the timing of onset of sex and a regression model for involvement in multiple sexual partnerships reveal that among the forms of deprivation explored, food deprivation is the only significant predictor of the timing of onset of sex and involvement in multiple sexual partnerships. The study concludes that the sexual activities of poor out-of-school girls are partly explained by their desire to overcome food deprivation and recommends that government and non-governmental-organisation programmes working with young people should address the problem of basic deprivation among adolescent girls.

Deng Q, Li Y, He W, Chen T, Liu N, Ma L, Qiu Z, Shang Z, Wang Z	The global spread of multidrug-resistant pathogenic fungi presents a serious threat to human health, necessitating the discovery of antifungals with unique modes of action(1). However, conventional activity-based screening for previously undescribed antibiotics has been hampered by the high-frequency rediscovery of known compounds and the lack of new antifungal targets(2). Here we report the discovery of a polyene antifungal antibiotic, mandimycin, using a phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery platform. Mandimycin is biosynthesized by the mand gene cluster, has evolved in a distinct manner from known polyene macrolide antibiotics and is modified with three deoxy sugars. It has demonstrated potent and broad-spectrum fungicidal activity against a wide range of multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens in both in vitro and in vivo settings. In contrast to known polyene macrolide antibiotics that target ergosterol, mandimycin has a unique mode of action that involves targeting various phospholipids in fungal cell membranes, resulting in the release of essential ions from fungal cells. This unique ability to bind multiple targets gives it robust fungicidal activity as well as the capability to evade resistance. The identification of mandimycin using the phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery strategy represents an important advancement in uncovering antimicrobial compounds with distinct modes of action, which could be developed to combat multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens.

10.1002/ctm2.70244	HIF-1α-induced long noncoding RNA LINC02776 promotes drug resistance of ovarian cancer by increasing polyADP-ribosylation.	Wu Y, Zeng Y, Wu Y, Ha X, Feng Z, Liu C, Liu Z, Wang J, Ju X, Huang S, Liang L, Zheng B, Yang L, Wang J, Wu X, Li S, Wen H	BACKGROUND: Chemoresistance remains a major hurdle in ovarian cancer (OC) treatment, as many patients eventually develop resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy and/or PARP inhibitors (PARPi). METHODS: We performed transcriptome-wide analysis by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of platinum-resistant and -sensitive OC tissues. We demonstrated the role of LINC02776 in platinum resistance in OC cells, mice models and patient-derived organoid (PDO) models. RESULTS: We identify the long noncoding RNA LINC02776 as a critical factor of platinum resistance. Elevated expression of LINC02776 is observed in platinum-resistant OC and serves as an independent prognostic factor for OC patients. Functionally, silencing LINC02776 reduces proliferation and DNA damage repair in OC cells, thereby enhancing sensitivity to platinum and PARPi in both xenograft mouse models and patient-derived organoid (PDO) models with acquired chemoresistance. Mechanistically, LINC02776 binds to the catalytic domain of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), promoting PARP1-dependent polyADP-ribosylation (PARylation) and facilitating homologous recombination (HR) restoration. Additionally, high HIF-1α expression in platinum-resistant tissues further stimulates LINC02776 transcription. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that targeting LINC02776 represents a promising therapeutic strategy for OC patients who have developed resistance to platinum or PARPi. KEY POINTS: LINC02776 promotes OC cell proliferation by regulating DNA damage and apoptosis signaling pathways. LINC02776 binds PARP1 to promote DNA damage-triggered PARylation in OC cells. LINC02776 mediates cisplatin and olaparib resistance in OC cells by enhancing PARP1-mediated PARylation activity and regulating the PARP1-mediated HR pathway. The high expression of LINC02776 is induced by HIF-1α in platinum-resistant OC cells and tissues.	Clinical and translational medicine	/03/2025	HIF-1α-induced long noncoding RNA LINC02776 promotes drug resistance of ovarian cancer by increasing polyADP-ribosylation.. BACKGROUND: Chemoresistance remains a major hurdle in ovarian cancer (OC) treatment, as many patients eventually develop resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy and/or PARP inhibitors (PARPi). METHODS: We performed transcriptome-wide analysis by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of platinum-resistant and -sensitive OC tissues. We demonstrated the role of LINC02776 in platinum resistance in OC cells, mice models and patient-derived organoid (PDO) models. RESULTS: We identify the long noncoding RNA LINC02776 as a critical factor of platinum resistance. Elevated expression of LINC02776 is observed in platinum-resistant OC and serves as an independent prognostic factor for OC patients. Functionally, silencing LINC02776 reduces proliferation and DNA damage repair in OC cells, thereby enhancing sensitivity to platinum and PARPi in both xenograft mouse models and patient-derived organoid (PDO) models with acquired chemoresistance. Mechanistically, LINC02776 binds to the catalytic domain of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), promoting PARP1-dependent polyADP-ribosylation (PARylation) and facilitating homologous recombination (HR) restoration. Additionally, high HIF-1α expression in platinum-resistant tissues further stimulates LINC02776 transcription.

Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the temporal cortex from APOE2 carriers, APOE3 homozygotes, and APOE4 carriers, we found that AD-associated transcriptomic changes were highly APOE genotype dependent. Comparing AD with controls, APOE2 carriers showed upregulated synaptic and myelination-related pathways, preserving synapses and myelination at the protein level. Conversely, these pathways were downregulated in APOE3 homozygotes, resulting in reduced synaptic and myelination proteins. In APOE4 carriers, excitatory neurons displayed reduced synaptic pathways similar to APOE3, but oligodendrocytes showed upregulated myelination pathways like APOE2. However, their synaptic and myelination protein levels remained unchanged or increased. APOE4 carriers also showed increased pro-inflammatory signatures in microglia but reduced responses to amyloid-β pathology. These findings reveal APOE genotype-specific molecular alterations in AD across cell types.

Tessier AJ, Wang F, Korat AA, Eliassen AH, Chavarro J, Grodstein F, Li J, Liang L, Willett WC, Sun Q, Stampfer MJ, Hu FB, Guasch-Ferré M	As the global population ages, it is critical to identify diets that, beyond preventing noncommunicable diseases, optimally promote healthy aging. Here, using longitudinal questionnaire data from the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2016) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2016), we examined the association of long-term adherence to eight dietary patterns and ultraprocessed food consumption with healthy aging, as assessed according to measures of cognitive, physical and mental health, as well as living to 70 years of age free of chronic diseases. After up to 30 years of follow-up, 9,771 (9.3%) of 105,015 participants (66% women, mean age = 53 years (s.d. = 8)) achieved healthy aging. For each dietary pattern, higher adherence was associated with greater odds of healthy aging and its domains. The odds ratios for the highest quintile versus the lowest ranged from 1.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.35-1.57; healthful plant-based diet) to 1.86 (95% CI = 1.71-2.01; Alternative Healthy Eating Index). When the age threshold for healthy aging was shifted to 75 years, the Alternative Healthy Eating Index diet showed the strongest association with healthy aging, with an odds ratio of 2.24 (95% CI = 2.01-2.50). Higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, unsaturated fats, nuts, legumes and low-fat dairy products were linked to greater odds of healthy aging, whereas higher intakes of trans fats, sodium, sugary beverages and red or processed meats (or both) were inversely associated. Our findings suggest that dietary patterns rich in plant-based foods, with moderate inclusion of healthy animal-based foods, may enhance overall healthy aging, guiding future dietary guidelines.

Cao Y, Xu Y, Cao M, Chen N, Zeng Q, Lai MKP, Fan D, Sethi G, Cao Y	Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are increasingly prevalent as global populations age. Fluid biomarkers, derived from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, saliva, urine, and exosomes, offer a promising solution for early diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring. These biomarkers can reflect critical pathological processes like amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, α-syn misfolding, TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation, and neuronal damage, enabling detection long before clinical symptoms emerge. Recent advances in blood-based biomarkers, particularly plasma Aβ, phosphorylated tau, and TDP-43, have shown diagnostic accuracy equivalent to CSF biomarkers, offering more accessible testing options. This review discusses the current challenges in fluid biomarker research, including variability, standardization, and sensitivity issues, and explores how combining multiple biomarkers with clinical symptoms improves diagnostic reliability. Ethical considerations, future directions involving extracellular vehicles (EVs), and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) are also highlighted. Continued research efforts will be key to overcoming these obstacles, enabling fluid biomarkers to become crucial tools in personalized medicine for neurodegenerative diseases.

Zhang G, Lian Y, Li Q, Zhou S, Zhang L, Chen L, Tang J, Liu H, Li N, Pan Q, Gu Y, Lin N, Wang H, Wang X, Guo J, Zhang W, Jin Z, Xu B, Su X, Lin M, Han Q, Qin J	Chronic stress adversely affects intestinal health, but the specific neural pathways linking the brain to intestinal tissue are not fully understood. Here, we show that chronic stress-induced activation of the central amygdala-dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (CeA-DMV) pathway accelerates premature aging and impairs the stemness of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). This pathway influences ISC function independently of the microbiota, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the immune response, and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Under chronic stress, DMV-mediated vagal activation prompts cholinergic enteric neurons to release acetylcholine (ACh), which engages ISCs via the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRM3). This interaction activates the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, triggering growth arrest and mitochondrial fragmentation, thereby accelerating an aging-like decline in ISCs. Together, our findings provide insights into an alternative neural mechanism that links stress to intestinal dysfunction. Strategies targeting the DMV-associated vagal pathway represent potential therapeutic approaches for stress-induced intestinal diseases.

To understand whether this vulnerability could be therapeutically targeted in the most lethal form of prostate cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), we use a clinical small molecule, zotatifin, that targets the RNA helicase and translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A). Zotatifin represses tumorigenesis in patient-derived and xenograft models and prolonged survival in vivo alongside hormone therapy. Genome-wide transcriptome, translatome, and proteomic analysis reveals two important translational targets: androgen receptor (AR), a key oncogene in CRPC, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1A (HIF1A), an essential cancer modulator in hypoxia. We solve the structure of the 5' UTRs of these oncogenic mRNAs and strikingly observe complex structural remodeling of these select mRNAs by this small molecule.

10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00109-6	Calcitonin gene-related peptide-targeted therapy in migraine: current role and future perspectives.	Versijpt J, Paemeleire K, Reuter U, MaassenVanDenBrink A	Almost 40 years ago, the discovery of the vasoactive neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its role in migraine pathophysiology ushered in a new era in migraine treatment. Since 2018, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the CGRP pathway are available for migraine prevention. The approval of these drugs marks a pioneering development, as they are the first pharmacological agents specifically tailored for migraine prevention. Introduction of these agents contrasts the historical reliance on traditional preventive medications initially formulated for other indications and later repurposed for migraine therapy. Although the emergence of evidence on the efficacy and safety of CGRP-targeted mAbs has raised the bar for treatment success in migraine, their efficacy in other headache entities, such as cluster headache, is low to moderate. Small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists called gepants have also been proven to be effective both as acute and preventive migraine treatments. Furthermore, these agents have bridged the traditional categories of acute and preventive treatment strategies. Short-term prevention and treatment during the prodromal phase of migraine represent emerging strategies enabling clinicians to develop treatment approaches designed to meet changing patient needs; however, these strategies still require more formal evidence. Although solid data have been gathered, further research concerning the efficacy and long-term safety of drugs targeting the CGRP pathway and robust pharmacoeconomic evaluations are needed. Finally, randomised withdrawal and switching studies would facilitate the formulation of evidence-based guidance for the discontinuation of and switching between drugs targeting the CGRP pathway.

10.1002/rcm.8668	Quantification of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid from microbiome reactor fluids.	Fritz-Wallace K, Engelmann B, Krause JL, Schäpe SS, Pöppe J, Herberth G, Rösler U, Jehmlich N, von Bergen M, Rolle-Kampczyk U	RATIONALE: Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides and it is suspected to affect the intestinal microbiota through inhibition of aromatic amino acid synthesis via the shikimate pathway. In vitro microbiome bioreactors are increasingly used as model systems to investigate effects on intestinal microbiota and consequently methods for the quantitation of glyphosate and its degradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in microbiome model systems are required. METHODS: An optimized protocol enables the analysis of both glyphosate and AMPA by simple extraction with methanol:acetonitrile:water (2:3:1) without further enrichment steps. Glyphosate and AMPA are separated by liquid chromatography on an amide column and identified and quantified with a targeted tandem mass spectrometry method using a QTRAP 5500 system (AB Sciex). RESULTS: Our method has a limit of detection (LOD) in extracted water samples of <2 ng/mL for both glyphosate and AMPA. In complex intestinal medium, the LOD is 2 and 5 ng/mL for glyphosate and AMPA, respectively. These LODs allow for measurement at exposure-relevant concentrations. Glyphosate levels in a bioreactor model of porcine colon were determined and consequently it was verified whether AMPA was produced by porcine gut microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: The method presented here allows quantitation of glyphosate and AMPA in complex bioreactor fluids and thus enables studies of the impact of glyphosate and its metabolism on intestinal microbiota. In addition, the extraction protocol is compatible with an untargeted metabolomics analysis, thus allowing one to look for other perturbations caused by glyphosate in the same sample.

Here, we investigated macrophage responses to monosodium urate crystals, calcium pyrophosphate crystals, aluminum salts, and silica nanoparticles. While each particle induced a distinct gene expression pattern, we identified a common inflammatory signature and acute activation of lysosomal acidification genes. Using monosodium urate crystals as a model, we demonstrated that this lysosomal gene program is regulated by a 5'-prime-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent transcriptional network, including TFEB, TFE3, and the epigenetic regulators DNA methyl transferase 3a (DNMT3A) and DOT1L. This lysosomal acidification program operates in parallel with, but largely independently of, a JNK-AP-1-dependent network driving crystal-induced chemokine and cytokine expression. These findings reveal a bifurcation in pathways governing inflammatory and lysosomal responses, offering insights for treating particle-associated diseases.

This lysosomal acidification program operates in parallel with, but largely independently of, a JNK-AP-1-dependent network driving crystal-induced chemokine and cytokine expression. These findings reveal a bifurcation in pathways governing inflammatory and lysosomal responses, offering insights for treating particle-associated diseases.	particle uptake macrophage trigger bifurcated transcriptional pathway differentially regulate inflammation lysosomal gene expression exposure particle be driver several inflammatory disease here investigate macrophage response monosodium urate crystal calcium pyrophosphate crystal aluminum salt silica nanoparticle particle induce distinct gene expression pattern identify common inflammatory signature acute activation lysosomal acidification gene use monosodium urate crystal model demonstrate lysosomal gene program be regulate 5'-prime amp activate protein kinase ampk)-dependent transcriptional network include tfeb TFE3 epigenetic regulator dna methyl transferase 3a DNMT3A DOT1L lysosomal acidification program operate parallel largely independently jnk AP-1 dependent network drive crystal induce chemokine cytokine expression finding reveal bifurcation pathway govern inflammatory lysosomal response offer insight treat particle associate disease
10.1161/JAHA.124.039751	Impact of DNA-Methylation Age Acceleration on Long-Term Mortality Among US Adults With Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic Syndrome.	Wu S, Zhu J, Lyu S, Wang J, Shao X, Zhang H, Zhong Z, Liu H, Zheng L, Chen Y	BACKGROUND: The association between DNA methylation age acceleration (DNAmAA) and cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome stages and long-term mortality in the population with CKM syndrome remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: This cohort study included 1889 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2002) with CKM stages and DNA methylation age data. DNAmAA was calculated as residuals from the regression of DNA methylation age on chronological age. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, with cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality as secondary outcomes. Proportional odds models assessed the associations between DNAmAAs and CKM stages, and Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated the associations between DNAmAAs and mortality. Significant associations were found between DNAmAAs and advanced CKM stages, particularly for GrimAge2Mort acceleration (GrimAA) (odds ratio [OR], 1.547 [95% CI, 1.316-1.819]). Over an average follow-up of 14 years, 1015 deaths occurred. Each 5-unit increase in GrimAA was associated with a 50% increase in all-cause mortality (95% CI, 1.39-1.63), a 77% increase in cardiovascular mortality (95% CI, 1.46-2.15), and a 42% increase in noncardiovascular mortality (95% CI, 1.27-1.59). With the lowest GrimAA tertile as a reference, the highest GrimAA tertile showed hazard ratios of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.56-2.45) for all-cause mortality, 3.06 (95% CI, 2.13-4.40) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.65 (95% CI, 1.20-2.29) for noncardiovascular mortality. Mediation analysis indicated that GrimAA mediates the association between various exposures (including physical activity, Healthy Eating Index-2015 score, hemoglobin A1c, etc.) and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: GrimAA may serve as a valuable biomarker for assessing CKM stages and mortality risk in individuals with CKM syndrome, thereby informing personalized management strategies.

Wang Z, Chen Y, Gong K, Zhao B, Ning Y, Chen M, Li Y, Ali M, Timsina J, Liu M, Cruchaga C, Jia J	Accurate staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is crucial for therapeutic trials and prognosis, but existing fluid biomarkers lack specificity, especially for assessing tau deposition severity, in amyloid-beta (Aβ)-positive patients. We analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 136 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using more than 6,000 proteins. We apply machine learning to predict AD pathological stages defined by amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET). We identify two distinct protein panels: 16 proteins, including neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) and SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1), that distinguished Aβ-negative/tau-negative (A-T-) from A+ individuals and nine proteins, such as HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), that differentiated A+T+ from A+T- stages. These signatures outperform the established CSF biomarkers (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.92 versus 0.67-0.70) and accurately predicted disease progression over a decade. The findings are validated in both internal and external cohorts. These results underscore the potential of proteomic-based signatures to refine AD diagnostic criteria and improve patient stratification in clinical trials.	Cell reports.

10.1097/ALN.0000000000005460	Suzetrigine, a Non-Opioid NaV1.	Bertoch T, D'Aunno D, McCoun J, Solanki D, Taber L, Urban J, Oswald J, Swisher MW, Tian S, Miao X, Correll DJ, Negulescu P, Bozic C, Weiner SG	BACKGROUND: Opioids are effective for treating acute pain but have safety, tolerability, and addiction concerns while non-opioid analgesics have limited efficacy. Suzetrigine, an oral, non-opioid, small molecule, selectively inhibits the voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (NaV1.8) and has potential to provide efficacious and safe relief for acute pain, without addiction concerns. METHODS: To evaluate suzetrigine for treatment of acute pain, we conducted two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trials in adults with moderate-to-severe acute pain on the verbal categorical rating scale and ≥4 on the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) after abdominoplasty (N=1118) or bunionectomy (N=1073). After surgery, participants were randomized to suzetrigine (100mg then 50mg every 12hrs), hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen (HB/APAP; 5/325mg every 6hrs), or placebo for 48 hours. The primary endpoint was time-weighted sum of the pain intensity difference in NPRS from 0-48hrs (SPID48) versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints were SPID48 versus HB/APAP and time to ≥2-point reduction in NPRS from baseline versus placebo. RESULTS: The primary endpoint was achieved in both trials with suzetrigine demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in pain versus placebo. The least squares mean difference in SPID48 between suzetrigine and placebo was 48.4 (95%CI:33.6,63.1;P<0.0001) after abdominoplasty and 29.3 (95%CI:14.0,44.6; P=0.0002) after bunionectomy. Neither trial achieved the first key secondary endpoint of superiority of suzetrigine versus HB/APAP on SPID48. For the second key secondary endpoint of time to ≥2-point reduction in NPRS, suzetrigine had a more rapid onset of clinically meaningful pain relief versus placebo after abdominoplasty (119min versus 480mins, nominal P<0.0001) and bunionectomy (240mins versus 480mins, nominal P=0.0016).Adverse events (AEs) were similar to those seen in post-surgical settings. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with placebo, suzetrigine reduced moderate-to-severe acute pain over 48 hours after abdominoplasty or bunionectomy. Pain reduction with suzetrigine was similar to that with HB/APAP. Suzetrigine was associated with adverse events that were mild to moderate in severity.

Lin C, Xia M, Dai Y, Huang Q, Sun Z, Zhang G, Luo R, Peng Q, Li J, Wang X, Lin H, Gao X, Tang H, Shen X, Wang S, Jin L, Hao X, Zheng Y	Differential susceptibilities to various diseases and corresponding metabolite variations have been documented across diverse ethnic populations, but the genetic determinants of these disparities remain unclear. Here, we performed large-scale genome-wide association studies of 171 directly quantifiable metabolites from a nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics platform in 10,792 Han Chinese individuals. We identified 15 variant-metabolite associations, eight of which were successfully replicated in an independent Chinese population (n = 4,480). By cross-ancestry meta-analysis integrating 213,397 European individuals from the UK Biobank, we identified 228 additional variant-metabolite associations and improved fine-mapping precision. Moreover, two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses revealed evidence that genetically predicted levels of triglycerides in high-density lipoprotein were associated with a higher risk of coronary artery disease and that of glycine with a lower risk of heart failure in both ancestries. These findings enhance our understanding of the shared and specific genetic architecture of metabolites as well as their roles in complex diseases across populations.

Wollweber F, Xu J, Ponce-Toledo RI, Marxer F, Rodrigues-Oliveira T, Pössnecker A, Luo ZH, Malit JJL, Kokhanovska A, Wieczorek M, Schleper C, Pilhofer M	Microtubules are a hallmark of eukaryotes. Archaeal and bacterial homologs of tubulins typically form homopolymers and non-tubular superstructures. The origin of heterodimeric tubulins assembling into microtubules remains unclear. Here, we report the discovery of microtubule-forming tubulins in Asgard archaea, the closest known relatives of eukaryotes. These Asgard tubulins (AtubA/B) are closely related to eukaryotic α/β-tubulins and the enigmatic bacterial tubulins BtubA/B. Proteomics of Candidatus Lokiarchaeum ossiferum showed that AtubA/B were highly expressed. Cryoelectron microscopy structures demonstrate that AtubA/B form eukaryote-like heterodimers, which assembled into 5-protofilament bona fide microtubules in vitro. The additional paralog AtubB2 lacks a nucleotide-binding site and competitively displaced AtubB. These AtubA/B2 heterodimers polymerized into 7-protofilament non-canonical microtubules. In a sub-population of Ca. Lokiarchaeum ossiferum cells, cryo-tomography revealed tubular structures, while expansion microscopy identified AtubA/B cytoskeletal assemblies. Our findings suggest a pre-eukaryotic origin of microtubules and provide a framework for understanding the fundamental principles of microtubule assembly.

Benjafield AV, Pepin JL, Cistulli PA, Wimms A, Lavergne F, Sert Kuniyoshi FH, Munson SH, Schuler B, Reddy Badikol S, Wolfe KC, Willes L, Kelly C, Kendzerska T, Johnson DA, Heinzer R, Lee CH, Malhotra A	BACKGROUND: Data regarding the effect of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) on all-cause mortality are inconsistent. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to test the hypothesis that PAP therapy is associated with reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in people with OSA. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from database inception to Aug 22, 2023 (updated Sept 9, 2024), with no language or geographical restrictions. Reference lists of eligible studies and recent conference abstracts (2022-23) were also reviewed. We included outpatient studies (randomised controlled trials [RCTs] or confounder-adjusted, non-randomised controlled studies [NRCSs]) assessing the incidence of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or both in adults (aged ≥18 years) with OSA who were treated versus not treated with PAP; other study types and studies that evaluated only PAP adherence were excluded. Abstracts of all retrieved publications were independently screened by two of three researchers (BS, SRB, and KCW), with disagreements resolved by adjudication from another researcher (SHM). The AutoLit feature of the Nested Knowledge platform was used for the review and data-extraction phases. We analysed each log-transformed hazard ratio (HR) and SE using a linear random-effects model to estimate overall HRs and 95% CIs. To evaluate the risk of bias, we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for NRCSs. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023456627. FINDINGS: Of 5484 records identified by our search, 435 were assessed for eligibility and 30 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis (ten RCTs and 20 NRCSs). These studies included 1 175 615 participants, of whom 905 224 (77%) were male and 270 391 (23%) were female (SE 1·9), with a mean age of 59·5 (SE 1·4) years and a mean follow-up of 5·1 (0·5) years. The risk of bias was low to moderate. The risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0·63, 95% CI 0·56-0·72; p<0·0001) and cardiovascular mortality (0·45, 0·29-0·72; p<0·0001) was significantly lower in the PAP group than in the no-PAP group, and the clinically relevant benefit of PAP therapy increased with use. INTERPRETATION: Our results are consistent with a potentially beneficial effect of PAP therapy on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with OSA. Patients should be made aware of this effect of their treatment, which could result in greater acceptance of treatment initiation and greater adherence, leading to a higher likelihood of improved outcomes.

Abstracts of all retrieved publications were independently screened by two of three researchers (BS, SRB, and KCW), with disagreements resolved by adjudication from another researcher (SHM). The AutoLit feature of the Nested Knowledge platform was used for the review and data-extraction phases. We analysed each log-transformed hazard ratio (HR) and SE using a linear random-effects model to estimate overall HRs and 95% CIs. To evaluate the risk of bias, we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for NRCSs. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023456627. FINDINGS: Of 5484 records identified by our search, 435 were assessed for eligibility and 30 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis (ten RCTs and 20 NRCSs). These studies included 1 175 615 participants, of whom 905 224 (77%) were male and 270 391 (23%) were female (SE 1·9), with a mean age of 59·5 (SE 1·4) years and a mean follow-up of 5·1 (0·5) years. The risk of bias was low to moderate. The risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0·63, 95% CI 0·56-0·72; p<0·0001) and cardiovascular mortality (0·45, 0·29-0·72; p<0·0001) was significantly lower in the PAP group than in the no-PAP group, and the clinically relevant benefit of PAP therapy increased with use. INTERPRETATION: Our results are consistent with a potentially beneficial effect of PAP therapy on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with OSA. Patients should be made aware of this effect of their treatment, which could result in greater acceptance of treatment initiation and greater adherence, leading to a higher likelihood of improved outcomes.

We report here a preplanned analysis in the previously reported APPLE study, a phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy of the bevacizumab in combination with atezolizumab, plus platinum chemotherapy in metastatic, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the correlation of serum VEGF-A and its isoforms at baseline with treatment response by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We reveal that the addition of bevacizumab significantly improves the progression-free survival in patients with the low VEGF-A level. Our results demonstrate that measuring serum VEGF-A or its isoforms may identify NSCLC patients who are likely to benefit from the addition of bevacizumab to immunotherapy.

Zhou L, Lian G, Zhou T, Cai Z, Yang S, Li W, Cheng L, Ye Y, He M, Lu J, Deng Q, Huang B, Zhou X, Lu D, Zhi F, Cui J	Ferroptosis is closely linked with various pathophysiological processes, including aging, neurodegeneration, ischemia-reperfusion injury, viral infection and, notably, cancer progression; however, its post-translational regulatory mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we revealed a crucial role of S-palmitoylation in regulating ferroptosis through glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a pivotal enzyme that mitigates lipid peroxidation. We identified that zinc finger DHHC-domain containing protein 8 (zDHHC8), an S-acyltransferase that is highly expressed in multiple tumors, palmitoylates GPX4 at Cys75. Through small-molecule drug screening, we identified PF-670462, a zDHHC8-specific inhibitor that promotes the degradation of zDHHC8, consequently attenuating GPX4 palmitoylation and enhancing ferroptosis sensitivity. PF-670462 inhibition of zDHHC8 facilitates the CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell-induced ferroptosis of tumor cells, thereby improving the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in a B16-F10 xenograft model. Our findings reveal the prominent role of the zDHHC8-GPX4 axis in regulating ferroptosis and highlight the potential application of zDHHC8 inhibitors in anticancer therapy.

Marais G, Weissland T, Robin H, Vanvelcenaher JM, Lavoie JM, Pelayo P	The aim of the present study was to compare the physiological responses when the crank rate was chosen spontaneously (Ts) or set at +/- 10% (T-10%, T+10%) of the freely chosen rate, during two upper body exercises: i) a sub-maximal test (T(SUB)) in which intensities ranged from 50 to 80% (118.4 +/- 10.2 to 189.5 +/- 16.3 watts) of maximal power (MP) and ii) a supramaximal test (T(SUPRA)) in which power output was set at 110 and 120% (260.5 +/- 22.4 and 284.2 +/- 24.4 watts) of MP. Eight nationally and internationally ranked kayakers, aged 20 +/- 2 years, performed these tests in which power outputs were normalised in relation to the maximal power output determined during T(MP). In T(SUB+10%), oxygen uptake and ventilation were significantly (P< 0.05) higher than during T(SUBxS). In T(SUB+10%) and T(SUB-10%), energy expenditure was significantly (P<0.05) higher and gross and net efficiencies lower than during T(SUBxS). During T(SUPRA-10%) when the power output was set at 110% of MP, time to exhaustion was significantly higher (P<0.05) than during T(SUPRAxS). The findings of the present study suggest that upper body exercise performed on an ergocycle should be conducted using the freely and spontaneously chosen crank rate.

Sun Q, Tan F, Zhang L, Lu Y, Wei H, Li N, Jiang L, Zhou Y, Chen T, Lu L, Li GL, Qi J, Yang S, Chai R	Pathogenic mutations in the Gjb2 gene, encoding connexin 26, are the leading cause of autosomal-recessive hereditary deafness. Gene therapy holds significant promise for treating this. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated therapeutic gene delivery has been shown to be safe and effective in restoring hearing in both animal models and human patients. However, Gjb2 gene therapy has been hindered by the limited specificity and efficiency of the available AAV vectors. In this study, we screened AAV serotypes and found that co-administration of AAV1 and AAV-ie could effectively target Gjb2-expressing cells. However, the ectopic Gjb2 expression in hair cells induced by these AAVs could cause ototoxicity, which was addressed by employing the specific promoter SCpro. Co-injection of AAV1 and AAV-ie carrying exogenous Gjb2 driven by SCpro effectively restored hearing function in Gjb2-deficient mice. Moreover, the combined AAV system can transduce the cochleae of Bama miniature pigs and AAV administration into the inner ear of cynomolgus monkeys did not impair hearing and showed negligible systemic toxicity, indicating the efficiency and safety of this gene therapy in large animals. Thus, this study provides a strategy for Gjb2 gene therapy and lays a foundation for future clinical applications.

10.1186/s12889-025-22231-3	Exploring the nonlinear association between cardiometabolic index and hypertension in U.	Zhou H, Mao Y, Ye M, Zuo Z	BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a prevalent chronic disease affecting over 1.2 billion people worldwide, representing a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) and Triglyceride to High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio are established metabolic indicators linked to the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Recently, a Cardiometabolic Index (CMI), combining WHtR and TG/HDL-C ratios, has been proposed to provide a comprehensive assessment of metabolic health. This study investigates the association between CMI and hypertension using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). METHODS: The study utilized NHANES data from nine cycles spanning 2001 to 2018, encompassing 20,049 participants aged over 20. Exclusions were made for individuals with incomplete CMI or hypertension data, and pregnant women. CMI was calculated by multiplying the WHtR by the TG/HDL-C ratio. Hypertension was defined according to American Heart Association guidelines. The relationship between CMI and hypertension was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analyses, with additional subgroup analyses conducted based on demographic factors. Nonlinear relationships were analyzed using smoothing curve fitting techniques. RESULTS: The study identified a significant positive correlation between CMI and hypertension risk, with an increase of one unit in CMI associated with a 9% heightened risk of hypertension (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.13). The association remained significant across various demographic subgroups. A nonlinear relationship was observed, with a critical CMI threshold of 2.64. Below this threshold, higher CMI values were associated with a progressively higher prevalence of hypertension, whereas beyond this threshold, further increases in CMI did not significantly correlate with an elevated risk of hypertension. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that CMI is significantly associated with hypertension risk and may serve as a valuable tool for early screening and risk assessment, particularly in identifying individuals at higher risk before reaching the critical CMI threshold. These results underscore the importance of addressing metabolic health in the prevention and management of hypertension. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to establish causality, explore the clinical utility of CMI in hypertension screening, and examine its applicability in diverse populations.

ESGE/EHMSG/ESP suggest that gastric cancer screening or surveillance in asymptomatic individuals over 80 should be discontinued or not started, and that patients' comorbidities should be considered when treatment of superficial lesions is planned.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that a high quality endoscopy including the use of virtual chromoendoscopy (VCE), after proper training, is performed for screening, diagnosis, and staging of precancerous conditions (atrophy and intestinal metaplasia) and lesions (dysplasia or cancer), as well as after endoscopic therapy. VCE should be used to guide the sampling site for biopsies in the case of suspected neoplastic lesions as well as to guide biopsies for diagnosis and staging of gastric precancerous conditions, with random biopsies to be taken in the absence of endoscopically suspected changes. When there is a suspected early gastric neoplastic lesion, it should be properly described (location, size, Paris classification, vascular and mucosal pattern), photodocumented, and two targeted biopsies taken.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP do not recommend routine performance of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT prior to endoscopic resection unless there are signs of deep submucosal invasion or if the lesion is not considered suitable for endoscopic resection.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for differentiated gastric lesions clinically staged as dysplastic (low grade and high grade) or as intramucosal carcinoma (of any size if not ulcerated or ≤ 30 mm if ulcerated), with EMR being an alternative for Paris 0-IIa lesions of size ≤ 10 mm with low likelihood of malignancy.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP suggest that a decision about ESD can be considered for malignant lesions clinically staged as having minimal submucosal invasion if differentiated and ≤ 30 mm; or for malignant lesions clinically staged as intramucosal, undifferentiated and ≤ 20 mm; and in both cases with no ulcerative findings.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommends patient management based on the following histological risk after endoscopic resection: Curative/very low-risk resection (lymph node metastasis [LNM] risk < 0.5 %-1 %): en bloc R0 resection; dysplastic/pT1a, differentiated lesion, no lymphovascular invasion, independent of size if no ulceration and ≤ 30 mm if ulcerated. No further staging procedure or treatment is recommended.Curative/low-risk resection (LNM risk < 3 %): en bloc R0 resection; lesion with no lymphovascular invasion and: a) pT1b, invasion ≤ 500 µm, differentiated, size ≤ 30 mm; or b) pT1a, undifferentiated, size ≤ 20 mm and no ulceration. Staging should be completed, and further treatment is generally not necessary, but a multidisciplinary discussion is required. Local-risk resection (very low risk of LNM but increased risk of local persistence/recurrence): Piecemeal resection or tumor-positive horizontal margin of a lesion otherwise meeting curative/very low-risk criteria (or meeting low-risk criteria provided that there is no submucosal invasive tumor at the resection margin in the case of piecemeal resection or tumor-positive horizontal margin for pT1b lesions [invasion ≤ 500 µm; well-differentiated; size ≤ 30 mm, and VM0]). Endoscopic surveillance/re-treatment is recommended rather than other additional treatment. High-risk resection (noncurative): Any lesion with any of the following: (a) a positive vertical margin (if carcinoma) or lymphovascular invasion or deep submucosal invasion (> 500 µm from the muscularis mucosae); (b) poorly differentiated lesions if ulceration or size > 20 mm; (c) pT1b differentiated lesions with submucosal invasion ≤ 500 µm with size > 30 mm; or (d) intramucosal ulcerative lesion with size > 30 mm. Complete staging and strong consideration for additional treatments (surgery) in multidisciplinary discussion.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP suggest the use of validated endoscopic classifications of atrophy (e. g. Kimura-Takemoto) or intestinal metaplasia (e. g. endoscopic grading of gastric intestinal metaplasia [EGGIM]) to endoscopically stage precancerous conditions and stratify the risk for gastric cancer.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that biopsies should be taken from at least two topographic sites (2 biopsies from the antrum/incisura and 2 from the corpus, guided by VCE) in two separate, clearly labeled vials. Additional biopsy from the incisura is optional.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that patients with extensive endoscopic changes (Kimura C3 + or EGGIM 5 +) or advanced histological stages of atrophic gastritis (severe atrophic changes or intestinal metaplasia, or changes in both antrum and corpus, operative link on gastritis assessment/operative link on gastric intestinal metaplasia [OLGA/OLGIM] III/IV) should be followed up with high quality endoscopy every 3 years, irrespective of the individual's country of origin.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that no surveillance is proposed for patients with mild to moderate atrophy or intestinal metaplasia restricted to the antrum, in the absence of endoscopic signs of extensive lesions or other risk factors (family history, incomplete intestinal metaplasia, persistent H. pylori infection). This group constitutes most individuals found in clinical practice.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend H. pylori eradication for patients with precancerous conditions and after endoscopic or surgical therapy.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that patients should be advised to stop smoking and low-dose daily aspirin use may be considered for the prevention of gastric cancer in selected individuals with high risk for cardiovascular events.

At a population level, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE), the European Helicobacter and Microbiota Study Group (EHMSG), and the European Society of Pathology (ESP) suggest endoscopic screening for gastric cancer (and precancerous conditions) in high-risk regions (age-standardized rate [ASR] > 20 per 100 000 person-years) every 2 to 3 years or, if cost-effectiveness has been proven, in intermediate risk regions (ASR 10-20 per 100 000 person-years) every 5 years, but not in low-risk regions (ASR < 10).ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that irrespective of country of origin, individual gastric risk assessment and stratification of precancerous conditions is recommended for first-time gastroscopy.

10.1186/s12967-025-06378-6	CHI3L1 mediates radiation resistance in colorectal cancer by inhibiting ferroptosis via the p53/SLC7A11 pathway.	Jin M, Liu H, Zheng Z, Fang S, Xi Y, Liu K	BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is a key treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly rectal cancer; however, many patients are resistant to radiation. While it has been shown that CHI3L1 is associated with CRC progression, its specific function and regulatory mechanisms in radiation resistance remain unclear. METHODS: The levels of CHI3L1 in CRC and normal tissue samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. To assess the effects of CHI3L1 on CRC cell proliferative, migratory, and invasive capacities, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and Transwell assays were performed. Radiation resistance in CRC cells with varying CHI3L1 expression levels was evaluated through colony formation assay. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses were conducted to explore the correlation between CHI3L1 and p53 expression levels. Ferroptosis was assessed by determining reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) concentrations in cells with different CHI3L1 expression levels, and a xenograft mouse model was used to identify the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis in vivo. RESULTS: Significant CHI3L1 upregulated was observed in CRC tissues and was associated with promotion of malignant cell behaviors. The number of colonies in CHI3L1-overexpressing groups was significantly greater than that in the control groups following radiation, indicating increased radiation resistance in the former group. Furthermore, CHI3L1 overexpression was associated with p53 downregulation and elevated p53 ubiquitination. Notably, CHI3L1 inhibited the ferroptosis of CRC cells by suppressing p53 expression through the p53/SLC7A11 signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: CHI3L1 overexpression promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion, and radiation resistance of CRC cells. Elevated CHI3L1 expression is associated with increased p53 ubiquitination and SLC7A11 upregulation. CHI3L1 promotes radiation resistance by suppressing ferroptosis in CRC cells through the p53/SLC7A11 axis.

Liu X, Ma B, Hu S, Li D, Pan C, Xu Z, Chen H, Wang Y, Wang H	"Dynamic alterations in metal ion concentrations are observed in the pathological process of spinal cord injury (SCI). Hence, strategically supplying metal ions in a phase-adapted manner is promising to facilitate injured spinal cord repair by preventing pathological damage. To achieve this, a chimeric hydrogel microsphere with Mg(2+)-crosslinked methacrylate gelatin as the ""shell"" and Zn(2+)-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as the ""core"" was designed. The chimeric microspheres allow continuous delivery of Mg(2+) or Zn(2+) at the exact required phase in SCI pathological process. Early release of Mg(2+) reduced inflammation by diminishing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines due to changes in macrophage polarization, which further suppressed scar formation to create an ideal space for neural regeneration. The subsequently released Zn(2+) at the late phase effectively promoted neural cell proliferation and regeneration, which was accompanied by activation of mature neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons, leading to significant behavioral recovery. Thus, this study underscores the critical role of metal ions at different phases of injured spinal cord repair and describes the construction of an injectable chimeric hydrogel microsphere carrying distinct metal ions with a core-shell structure. Chimeric microspheres overcome the discrepancy between the inflammatory response and neural regeneration and are a promising therapeutic strategy for injured spinal cord repair."

Vogler M, Braun Y, Smith VM, Westhoff MA, Pereira RS, Pieper NM, Anders M, Callens M, Vervliet T, Abbas M, Macip S, Schmid R, Bultynck G, Dyer MJ	The B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein family critically controls apoptosis by regulating the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. In this cutting-edge review, we summarize the basic biology regulating the BCL2 family including canonical and non-canonical functions, and highlight milestones from basic research to clinical applications in cancer and other pathophysiological conditions. We review laboratory and clinical development of BH3-mimetics as well as more recent approaches including proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and tools targeting the BH4 domain of BCL2. The first BCL2-selective BH3-mimetic, venetoclax, showed remarkable efficacy with manageable toxicities and has transformed the treatment of several hematologic malignancies. Following its success, several chemically similar BCL2 inhibitors such as sonrotoclax and lisaftoclax are currently under clinical evaluation, alone and in combination. Genetic analysis highlights the importance of BCL-X(L) and MCL1 across different cancer types and the possible utility of BH3-mimetics targeting these proteins. However, the development of BH3-mimetics targeting BCL-X(L) or MCL1 has been more challenging, with on-target toxicities including thrombocytopenia for BCL-X(L) and cardiac toxicities for MCL1 inhibitors precluding clinical development. Tumor-specific BCL-X(L) or MCL1 inhibition may be achieved by novel targeting approaches using PROTACs or selective drug delivery strategies and would be transformational in many subtypes of malignancy. Taken together, we envision that the targeting of BCL2 proteins, while already a success story of translational research, may in the foreseeable future have broader clinical applicability and improve the treatment of multiple diseases.

Zhou Q, Gao J, Wu G, Wang C, Yang Y, Huang T, Wang Y, Yue T, Gao Z, Xie H, Xiong F, Xiang K, Yong T, Zhang W, Zhang T, Kong W, Chen C, Zhang S, Yu Q, Fan X, Liu S, Liu Y, Wang CY	Among different age groups, middle-aged individuals are particularly susceptible to obesity, with a 22% higher risk of all-cause mortality. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we identify adipose progenitor cells (APCs) in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of middle-aged subjects as potential causes of midlife obesity. Specifically, the extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from APCs display an impaired ability to mitigate the inflammaging of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) in middle-aged individuals. Mechanistically, these EVs, lacking miR-145-5p, fail to suppress the expression of L-selectin in ATMs, thereby facilitating their M1 program via the NF-κB signaling pathway. In contrast, EVs from young APCs effectively inhibit M1 macrophage polarization. Accordingly, targeted liposomes are designed to deliver miR-145-5p mimics to ATMs, which effectively prevent the obesity in middle-aged mice. Collectively, our findings highlight the role of APC-derived EVs in midlife obesity and propose miR-145-5pas a promising therapeutic target for clinical applications.

Jiang C, He X, Chen X, Huang J, Liu Y, Zhang J, Chen H, Sui X, Lv X, Zhao X, Xiao C, Xiao J, Zhang J, Lu T, Chen H, Li H, Wang H, Lv G, Ye L, Li R, Zheng J, Yao J, Kang Y, Wang T, Li H, Wang J, Zhang Y, Chen G, Cai J, Xiang AP, Yang Y	Previous studies have demonstrated that lactate accumulation, a common hallmark for metabolic deprivation in solid tumors, could actively drive tumor invasion and metastasis. However, whether lactate influences the biogenesis of tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs), the prerequisite for distant metastasis formation, remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that extracellular lactate, after taken up by tumor cells via lactate transporter MCT1, drove the release of TDE mainly through facilitating multivesicular body (MVB) trafficking towards plasma membrane instead of lysosome. Mechanistically, lactate promoted p300-mediated Rab7A lactylation, which hereafter inhibited its GTPase activity and promoted MVB docking with plasma membrane. Moreover, lactate administration enriched integrin β4 and ECM remodeling-related proteins in TDE cargos, which promoted pulmonary pre-metastatic niche formation. Combinatorial inhibition of MCT1 and p300 significantly abrogated HCC metastasis in a clinical-relevant PDX model. In summary, we demonstrated that lactate promote TDE biogenesis and HCC pulmonary metastasis, and proposed a potential clinical strategy targeting TDEs to prevent HCC metastasis.

Ning Y, Chen M, Yang H, Jia J	"BACKGROUND: Research has shown that sedentary behavior (SB) may increase dementia risk, but it remains unclear whether concentrated moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) can compensate such negative effects. This study aimed to explore the association between different MVPA patterns combined with SB time and the risk of dementia. METHODS: This prospective study used data from the UK Biobank cohort, which provided accelerometer-based physical activity data for a full week from February 2013 to December 2015. Participants were categorized into ""weekend warriors (WW)"" group, engaged in more than 50% MVPA (≥ 150 min/week) on 1 to 2 days; inactive group (total MVPA < 150 min/week); and regular group, who met the recommended MVPA (≥ 150 min/week) but not WW. The participants were further divided into six groups based on SB duration (≥ 8.52 h/day or < 8.52 h/day). A multivariable Cox model was used to assess the relationship between these patterns and the risk of dementia, adjusted by age, gender, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation index, education level, employment status, alcohol consumption, smoking, BMI, and baseline comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes). RESULTS: We included 91,948 participants without dementia at baseline. During a median follow-up of 7.93 years, 736 participants developed all-cause dementia. When the MVPA threshold was set at 150 min per week, 16,149 participants (17.5%) were classified as WW with long SB, 19,055 (20.7%) as regular with long SB, and 21,909 (23.8%) as inactive with long SB. Compared to inactive and long SB time, the WW group showed a reduction in dementia risk (WW with long SB time: HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.54-0.87, P = 0.002; WW with short SB time: HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.56-0.97, P = 0.029).

The aim is to provide practical recommendations on the clinical management of UTUC with a focus on diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. METHODS: For the 2025 guidelines on UTUC, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Key recommendations emphasise the importance of thorough diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for patients with UTUC. The guidelines stress the importance of appropriate treatment taking into account patient values and preferences. Key updates in the 2025 UTUC guidelines include: significant changes to the recommendations for UTUC diagnosis; complete revision of the sections addressing risk stratification, ureteroscopy, and the surgical approach for radical nephroureterectomy; addition of four new recommendations, two related to kidney-sparing management of localised low-risk UTUC and a further two related to management of high-risk nonmetastatic UTUC; a review and adaptation of recommendation for UTUC follow-up; and addition of a new section addressing quality indicators for UTUC management. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This overview of the 2025 EAU guidelines on UTUC offers valuable insights into risk factors, diagnosis, classification, treatment, and follow-up for UTUC. The guidelines contain information on the management of individual patients according to the current best evidence and are designed for effective integration in clinical practice.

10.1186/s12883-025-04132-5	Effects of very early exercise on inflammatory markers and clinical outcomes in patients with ischaemic stroke- a randomized controlled trial.	Ademoyegun AB, Awotidebe TO, Odetunde MO, Inaolaji SO, Bakare SO, Azeez FW, Olayemi O	BACKGROUND: Apart from the limited evidence of the effects of very early exercise (VEE) on clinical outcomes (COs) in stroke, better knowledge is required to understand the cellular action induced by VEE. This study investigated the effects of VEE on inflammatory markers (IMs) and COs. It further evaluated the association between acute changes in IMs and COs at follow-up in individuals with first-ever mild-to-moderate ischaemic stroke. METHODS: A prospective, single-center, single-blind, randomized controlled trial (retrospectively registered: PACTR202406755848901; 10-06-2024) was conducted. Forty-eight patients randomized (1:1) into the VEE group (VEEG) and usual care group (UCG) completed the follow-up. Within 24 h of stroke onset, patients in VEEG underwent 45 min of VEE twice daily, amounting to 1.5 h/d, for seven days while patients in UCG received regular turning and positioning. The levels of IMs including interleukin-6 (IL-6), fibrinogen, leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes were assessed at baseline, 4th, and 7th day for both groups. Thereafter, each patient received 90-min follow-up physiotherapy twice weekly for three months. Motor impairment, physical disability, functional independence, anxiety, depression, and cognition were evaluated at 1st and 3rd month of follow-up. RESULTS: On the 4th and 7th day, patients in VEEG show trends of lower levels of IL-6, leucocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes and higher levels of lymphocytes. However, a non-linear effect of VEE on plasma fibrinogen was observed compared to UC. Furthermore, better improvement in motor impairment, physical disability, functional independence, anxiety, depression, and cognition were observed in VEEG. The positive modulation of IMs by VEE was associated with COs over time, including associations between changes in IL-6 at days 4 and 7 and 3-month functional independence (r(s) = -0.33; p = 0.019; r(s) = -0.33; p = 0.021), and at day 7 and 3-month motor impairment (r(s) = 0.30; p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Initiating moderate-intensity exercise within 24 h appears beneficial in positively modulating IMs, including IL-6, at the acute stage and improving the physical, motor, cognitive, and affective functions at 1-and 3-month follow-up. The association between exercise-induced acute changes in IMs and improved COs over time highlights the potential role of moderate-intensity VEE in enhancing stroke recovery through positive inflammatory modulation.

10.1186/s12933-025-02687-8	Association of triglyceride-glucose index trajectories with the risk of worsening heart failure in elderly patients with chronic heart failure and type 2 diabetes: a competing risk analysis.	Lai Y, Lin C, Liu X, Liu Y, Cai H, Zhao N, Gao Y, Yi Z, Huang J, Li M, Xu L	BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose index serves as a dependable biomarker for gauging insulin resistance linked to cardiovascular disease. Our study was designed to investigate how the trajectory of the triglyceride-glucose index relates to the risk of worsening heart failure and overall mortality in patients aged 60 years and older with chronic heart failure and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This study enrolled 466 patients who had ≥ 3 medical exams. The formula for calculating the triglyceride-glucose index was ln (fasting triglycerides [mg/dL] × fasting blood glucose [mg/dL]/2). The trajectory of the triglyceride-glucose index in longitudinal analysis was analyzed via linear mixed models. The relationships between the trajectory of the TyG index and the risk of worsening heart failure and overall mortality were analyzed via competing Cox regression analysis and mixed-effects Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: After the variables adjustment, compared with the first quartile group, the adjusted hazard ratios for worsening heart failure in top quartile group were 2.40 (1.35-3.28) for 10-year follow-up, and 2.09 (1.22-3.58) for overall follow-up duration. The adjusted hazard ratios for overall mortality in top quartile group were 1.99 (1.56-3.14) for 10-year follow-up, and 1.87 (1.22-2.88) for overall follow-up duration. Compared with the low decreasing trajectory, adjusted hazard ratios for worsening heart failure of high decreasing trajectory were 1.37 (1.10-1.71) for the 5-year follow-up, 1.78 (1.10-2.88) for 10-year follow-up, and 1.67 (1.04-2.68) for overall follow-up duration. The adjusted hazard ratios for overall mortality were 2.16 (1.39-3.35) for 10-year follow-up, and 2.23 (1.46-3.40) for overall follow-up duration. CONCLUSION: During follow-up, a higher baseline level of TyG index and a high decreasing trajectory were independently associated with long-term worsening heart failure and an increased risk of overall mortality.	Cardiovascular diabetology	21/03/2025	Association of triglyceride-glucose index trajectories with the risk of worsening heart failure in elderly patients with chronic heart failure and type 2 diabetes: a competing risk analysis.. BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose index serves as a dependable biomarker for gauging insulin resistance linked to cardiovascular disease. Our study was designed to investigate how the trajectory of the triglyceride-glucose index relates to the risk of worsening heart failure and overall mortality in patients aged 60 years and older with chronic heart failure and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This study enrolled 466 patients who had ≥ 3 medical exams. The formula for calculating the triglyceride-glucose index was ln (fasting triglycerides [mg/dL] × fasting blood glucose [mg/dL]/2). The trajectory of the triglyceride-glucose index in longitudinal analysis was analyzed via linear mixed models. The relationships between the trajectory of the TyG index and the risk of worsening heart failure and overall mortality were analyzed via competing Cox regression analysis and mixed-effects Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: After the variables adjustment, compared with the first quartile group, the adjusted hazard ratios for worsening heart failure in top quartile group were 2.40 (1.35-3.28) for 10-year follow-up, and 2.09 (1.22-3.58) for overall follow-up duration. The adjusted hazard ratios for overall mortality in top quartile group were 1.99 (1.56-3.14) for 10-year follow-up, and 1.87 (1.22-2.88) for overall follow-up duration. Compared with the low decreasing trajectory, adjusted hazard ratios for worsening heart failure of high decreasing trajectory were 1.37 (1.10-1.71) for the 5-year follow-up, 1.78 (1.10-2.88) for 10-year follow-up, and 1.67 (1.04-2.68) for overall follow-up duration. The adjusted hazard ratios for overall mortality were 2.16 (1.39-3.35) for 10-year follow-up, and 2.23 (1.46-3.40) for overall follow-up duration. CONCLUSION: During follow-up, a higher baseline level of TyG index and a high decreasing trajectory were independently associated with long-term worsening heart failure and an increased risk of overall mortality.	association triglyceride glucose index trajectory risk worsen heart failure elderly patient chronic heart failure type 2 diabetes compete risk analysis background triglyceride glucose index serve dependable biomarker gauge insulin resistance link cardiovascular disease study be design to investigate trajectory triglyceride glucose index relate risk worsen heart failure overall mortality patient age 60 year old chronic heart failure type 2 diabetes method study enrol 466 patient have ≥ 3 medical exam formula calculate triglyceride glucose index be ln fast triglyceride mg dl × fast blood glucose mg dl]/2 trajectory triglyceride glucose index longitudinal analysis be analyze linear mixed model relationship trajectory tyg index risk worsen heart failure overall mortality be analyze compete cox regression analysis mixed effect cox regression analysis result variable adjustment compare first quartile group adjusted hazard ratio worsen heart failure top quartile group be 2.40 1.35 3.28 10 year follow up 2.09 1.22 3.58 overall follow up duration adjusted hazard ratio overall mortality top quartile group be 1.99 1.56 3.14 10 year follow up 1.87 1.22 2.88 overall follow up duration compare low decrease trajectory adjusted hazard ratio worsen heart failure high decrease trajectory be 1.37 1.10 1.71 5 year follow up 1.78 1.10 2.88 10 year follow up 1.67 1.04 2.68 overall follow up duration adjusted hazard ratio overall mortality be 2.16 1.39 3.35 10 year follow up 2.23 1.46 3.40 overall follow up duration conclusion follow up high baseline level tyg index high decrease trajectory be independently associate long term worsen heart failure increase risk overall mortality
10.1136/gutjnl-2024-334466	Rectal diclofenac versus indomethacin for prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis (DIPPP): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial.	Kang X, Xia M, Wang J, Wang X, Luo H, Qin W, Liang Z, Zhao G, Yang L, Sun H, Tao J, Ning B, Zhong L, Zhang R, Ma X, Zhao J, Yue L, Jin H, Kang C, Ren G, Liang S, Wang H, Wang L, Nie Y, Wu K, Fan DM, Pan Y	BACKGROUND: Recent meta-analyses suggested diclofenac may be superior to indomethacin in preventing post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP). The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy of 100 mg rectal indomethacin versus diclofenac on PEP incidences. DESIGN: This multicentre, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial was conducted in nine tertiary centres in China. Patients with low and high risk for PEP and native papilla were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive 100 mg diclofenac or 100 mg indomethacin rectally before ERCP. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PEP defined by the Cotton consensus. The intention-to-treat principle was conducted for the analysis. RESULTS: The trial was terminated early for futility after the predetermined first interim analysis. Between June 2023 and May 2024, 1204 patients were randomised into the diclofenac group (n=600) or indomethacin group (n=604). Baseline characteristics were balanced. The primary outcome occurred in 53 patients (8.8%) of 600 patients allocated to the diclofenac group and 37 patients (6.1%) of 604 patients allocated to the indomethacin group (relative risk 1.44; 95% CI 0.96 to 2.16, p=0.074). PEP occurred in 35 (14.2%) of 247 high-risk patients in the diclofenac group and 26 (9.8%) of 266 high-risk patients in the indomethacin group (p=0.124). PEP incidences were also comparable in low-risk patients between the two groups (18/353 (5.1%) vs 11/338 (3.3%), p=0.227). Other ERCP-related complications did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Pre-procedure 100 mg rectal diclofenac was not superior to the same dose of rectal indomethacin regarding preventing PEP. These findings supported current clinical practice guidelines of 100 mg indomethacin or diclofenac for PEP prophylaxis in patients without contraindications.

Li H, Hu Y, Li J, He J, Yu G, Wang J, Lin X	The rapid success of RNA vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 has sparked interest in their use for cancer immunotherapy. Although many cancers originate in mucosal tissues, current RNA cancer vaccines are mainly administered non-mucosally. Here, we developed a non-invasive intranasal cancer vaccine utilizing circular RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles to induce localized mucosal immune responses. This strategy elicited potent anti-tumor T cell responses in preclinical lung cancer models while mitigating the systemic adverse effects commonly associated with intravenous RNA vaccination. Specifically, type 1 conventional dendritic cells were indispensable for T cell priming post-vaccination, with both alveolar macrophages and type 1 conventional dendritic cells boosting antigen-specific T cell responses in lung tissues. Moreover, the vaccination facilitated the expansion of both endogenous and adoptive transferred antigen-specific T cells, resulting in robust anti-tumor efficacy. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the vaccination reprograms endogenous T cells, enhancing their cytotoxicity and inducing a memory-like phenotype. Additionally, the intranasal vaccine can modulate the response of CAR-T cells to augment therapeutic efficacy against tumor cells expressing specific tumor-associated antigens. Collectively, the intranasal RNA vaccine strategy represents a novel and promising approach for developing RNA vaccines targeting mucosal malignancies.

Wang M, He Z, Wang A, Sun S, Li J, Liu F, Li C, Yang C, Lei J, Yu Y, Ma S, Wang S, Zhang W, Yu Z, Liu GH, Qu J	Lumbar disc (LD) herniation and aging are prevalent conditions that can result in substantial morbidity. This study aimed to clarify the mechanisms connecting the LD aging and herniation, particularly focusing on cellular senescence and molecular alterations in the nucleus pulposus (NP). We performed a detailed analysis of NP samples from a diverse cohort, including individuals of varying ages and those with diagnosed LD herniation. Our methodology combined histological assessments with single-nucleus RNA sequencing to identify phenotypic and molecular changes related to NP aging and herniation. We discovered that cellular senescence and a decrease in nucleus pulposus progenitor cells (NPPCs) are central to both processes. Additionally, we found an age-related increase in NFAT1 expression that promotes NPPC senescence and contributes to both aging and herniation of LD. This research offers fresh insights into LD aging and its associated pathologies, potentially guiding the development of new therapeutic strategies to target the root causes of LD herniation and aging.

Wang Z, Ge S, Liao T, Yuan M, Qian W, Chen Q, Liang W, Cheng X, Zhou Q, Ju Z, Zhu H, Xiong W	Emerging evidence has unveiled heterogeneity in phenotypic and transcriptional alterations at the single-cell level during oxidative stress and senescence. Despite the pivotal roles of cellular metabolism, a comprehensive elucidation of metabolomic heterogeneity in cells and its connection with cellular oxidative and senescent status remains elusive. By integrating single-cell live imaging with mass spectrometry (SCLIMS), we establish a cross-modality technique capturing both metabolome and oxidative level in individual cells. The SCLIMS demonstrates substantial metabolomic heterogeneity among cells with diverse oxidative levels. Furthermore, the single-cell metabolome predicted heterogeneous states of cells. Remarkably, the pre-existing metabolomic heterogeneity determines the divergent cellular fate upon oxidative insult. Supplementation of key metabolites screened by SCLIMS resulted in a reduction in cellular oxidative levels and an extension of C. elegans lifespan. Altogether, SCLIMS represents a potent tool for integrative metabolomics and phenotypic profiling at the single-cell level, offering innovative approaches to investigate metabolic heterogeneity in cellular processes.

Using the mouse intestine, a striking and tractable model of organ resizing, we find that reproductive remodeling is anticipatory and distinct from diet- or microbiota-induced resizing. Reproductive remodeling involves partially irreversible elongation of the small intestine and fully reversible growth of its epithelial villi, associated with an expansion of isthmus progenitors and accelerated enterocyte migration. We identify induction of the SGLT3a transporter in a subset of enterocytes as an early reproductive hallmark. Electrophysiological and genetic interrogations indicate that SGLT3a does not sustain digestive functions or enterocyte health; rather, it detects protons and sodium to extrinsically support the expansion of adjacent Fgfbp1-positive isthmus progenitors, promoting villus growth. Our findings reveal unanticipated specificity to physiological organ remodeling. We suggest that organ- and state-specific growth programs could be leveraged to improve pregnancy outcomes or prevent maladaptive consequences of such growth.

Chen L, Zhao R, Zhang Y	BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is the major cause of tooth loss in adults and one of the most common non-communicable diseases. Clinically, periodontitis impairs oral health and associated with various systemic diseases. Maintaining a healthy diet is considered risk reduction of periodontitis. To explore the causal effect between dietary data and periodontitis by Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. METHODS: A total of 11,704 participants and 21 dietary variables from the NHANES were in random forest to rank the importance in predicting periodontitis. Data were from the genome wide association studies (GWASs) database to estimate causal relationships between diet data and periodontitis. Two-sample MR analyses were conducted by using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. RESULTS: The MR showed alcohol consumption and sugars intake increased the risk of chronic periodontitis with odds ratio (OR) 2.768 (95% CI: 1.03e + 00-7.42e + 00) and 2.123 (95% CI: 1.06e + 00-4.26e + 00) respectively. Vitamins and minerals, including folic acid and folate, magnesium, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, calcium, vitamin D and zinc, were not causally associated with chronic periodontitis. Alcohol consumption greater than 2.5 drinks per day and sugar intake more than 4.88 g increased the risk of periodontitis, with a calculated relative risk of 1.33 and 1.61, respectively. CONCLUSION: It is suggested to drink alcohol less than 2.5 drinks/day and consume sugar less than 4.88 g/day to avoid alcohol and sugar consumption promoting the development of periodontitis. Establishing a dietary pattern conducive to periodontal health may be the focus of further clinical research.

Establishing a dietary pattern conducive to periodontal health may be the focus of further clinical research.	association adjustable dietary factor periodontitis nhanes 2009 2014 mendelian randomization background periodontitis be major cause tooth loss adult one most common non communicable disease clinically periodontitis impairs oral health associate various systemic disease maintain healthy diet be consider risk reduction periodontitis to explore causal effect dietary datum periodontitis mendelian randomization mr analysis method total 11,704 participant 21 dietary variable nhanes be random forest to rank importance predict periodontitis datum be genome wide association study gwas database to estimate causal relationship diet datum periodontitis two sample mr analysis be conduct use inverse variance weighted ivw method result mr show alcohol consumption sugar intake increase risk chronic periodontitis odd ratio or 2.768 95 ci 1.03e + 00 7.42e + 00 2.123 95 ci 1.06e + 00 4.26e + 00 respectively vitamin mineral include folic acid folate magnesium vitamin a vitamin e vitamin c calcium vitamin d zinc be not causally associate chronic periodontitis alcohol consumption great 2.5 drink day sugar intake more 4.88 g increase risk periodontitis calculate relative risk 1.33 1.61 respectively conclusion be suggest to drink alcohol less 2.5 drink day consume sugar less 4.88 g day to avoid alcohol sugar consumption promote development periodontitis establish dietary pattern conducive periodontal health may be focus further clinical research
10.1038/s41422-025-01095-7	Molecular mechanism of the arrestin-biased agonism of neurotensin receptor 1 by an intracellular allosteric modulator.	Sun D, Li X, Yuan Q, Wang Y, Shi P, Zhang H, Wang T, Sun W, Ling S, Liu Y, Lai J, Xie W, Yin W, Liu L, Xu HE, Tian C	"Biased allosteric modulators (BAMs) of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been at the forefront of drug discovery owing to their potential to selectively stimulate therapeutically relevant signaling and avoid on-target side effects.

We aimed to establish novel comprehensive evaluation scales for cachexia specific to patients with solid tumours. METHODS: This study included 12 651 patients (males: 6793 [53.7%]; females: 5858 [46.3%]; medium age: 58 [interquartile range:50/66] years; medium follow-up duration: 24.16 [13.32/44.84] months; 4271 [33.8%] patients died; mean survival: 55.53 [95% confidence interval, 54.87/56.10] months; 3344 [26.4%], 4184 [33.1%] and 5123 [40.5%] patients with Stage I-II, III and IV tumour, respectively; derivation set: 10022, validation set: 2629 patients) with 14 types of solid tumours, including lung, gastric, liver, breast, oesophageal, cervical, bladder, pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, colorectal cancer, nasopharyngeal and endometrial carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, from an open and ongoing multicentre cohort study in China. Risk factors for cachexia, including tumour characteristics and nutritional parameters, were examined to develop diagnostic scales using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Ten nutrition items (body mass index, weight loss, intake reduction, physical activity function, fatigue, handgrip strength, anorexia, albumin level, albumin/globulin ratio and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) with different weighted scores were identified to construct a nutrition-weighted scoring scale (NWSS) for nutrition risk. Tumour type and tumour burden status (tumour-node-metastasis stage and radical or non-radical tumour) were determined to construct a disease-weighted scoring scale (DWSS) for disease risk. A lumped scale (5 × 5 matrix) established using a five-grade classification of nutrition and disease risk was used to determine a five-grade classification of comprehensive cachexia risk: A, no cachexia risk (reference; lowest disease and nutrition risks); B, cachexia risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.517 [4.033/5.058]); C, pre-cachexia (HR = 9.755 [8.73/10.901], medium survival = 21.21 months); D, cachexia (HR = 16.901 [14.995/19.049], medium survival = 11.61 months); and E, refractory cachexia (HR = 31.879 [28.244/35.981], medium survival = 4.83 months, highest disease and nutrition risks) (p < 0.001). Patients in Categories A-D benefited from nutrition therapy and anti-tumour treatments to varying degrees. Patients in Category E were clinically refractory to nutrition therapy without prolonged survival compared with patients without nutrition therapy (medium survival, pre-hospitalization nutrition therapy vs. hospitalization nutrition therapy vs. without nutrition therapy, 2.89 [1.91/3.88] vs. 4.04 [3.21/4.88] vs. 5.89 [4.73/7.04] months, p = 0.015) and anti-tumour treatments without prolonged survival compared with patients receiving palliative care (medium survival, radical anti-tumour treatments vs. adjuvant anti-tumour treatments vs. palliative anti-tumour treatments vs. and palliative care, 6.48 [4.42/8.53] vs. 6.48 [3.23/9.73] vs. 4.83 [4.22/5.44] vs. 2.70 [1.09/4.30] months, p = 0.263).

Huang R, Shen ZY, Huang D, Zhao SH, Dan LX, Wu P, Tang QZ, Ma ZG	Anti-programmed death 1 (αPD1) immune checkpoint blockade is used in combination for cancer treatment but associated with cardiovascular toxicity. Leflunomide (Lef) can suppress the growth of several tumor and mitigate cardiac remodeling in mice. However, the role of Lef in αPD1-induced cardiotoxicity remains unclear. Here, we report that Lef treatment inhibits αPD1-related cardiotoxicity without compromising the efficacy of αPD1-mediated immunotherapy. Lef changes community structure of gut microbiota in αPD1-treated melanoma-bearing mice. Moreover, mice receiving microbiota transplants from Lef+αPD1-treated melanoma-bearing mice have better cardiac function compared to mice receiving transplants from αPD1-treated mice. Mechanistically, we analyze metabolomics and identify indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), which protects cardiac dysfunction in αPD1-treated mice. IPA can directly bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and promote phosphoinositide 3-kinase expression, thus curtailing the cardiomyocyte response to immune injury. Our findings reveal that Lef mitigates αPD1-induced cardiac toxicity in melanoma-bearing mice through modulation of the microbiota-IPA-heart axis.

10.1093/cid/ciaf132	Paucibacillary tuberculosis drives the low positive predictive value of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra for rifampicin resistance detection in low-prevalence settings.	Cuella-Martin I, Hakizayezu F, Ahmed A, Runyambo D, Niyompano H, Keysers J, De Rijk WB, Mulders W, Mitchell EMH, Decroo T, Habimana YM, Migambi P, Muvunyi CM, de Jong BC, Rigouts L, Ngabonziza JCS	BACKGROUND: Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra) aimed to improve the specificity in identifying rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB), compared to Xpert MTB/RIF. METHODS: In a nationwide study in Rwanda, patients diagnosed with RR-TB by Ultra between December 2021 and January 2024 underwent repeat Ultra testing, complemented by rpoB gene sequencing and phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing (pDST), serving as reference tests. RESULTS: Of 129 patients initially diagnosed with RR-TB by Ultra, only 41 (32%) had concordant rifampicin results upon repeat Ultra testing. The remaining 88 patients (68%) had unconfirmed resistance on repeat Ultra. Reference testing was available for 40 (98%) of 41 confirmed cases, all verified as true RR-TB. Among 88 unconfirmed cases, reference testing was available for 61 (69%), with seven (11%) confirmed as true RR-TB, while 54 (89%) were found to have rifampicin-susceptible TB. Notably, 89% of 55 patients with very low bacillary loads on their initial Ultra had false RR-TB results, a significantly higher risk of false resistance compared to other bacillary load categories combined (risk ratio: 8.20; 95% CI: 3.56-18.85; p<0.001). Consequently, 53% (54/101) of initial RR patients with available reference testing received unnecessary RR-TB treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Ultra represents a valuable tool for rapid RR-TB detection, however, in low prevalence settings its low positive predictive value for RR detection is largely driven by samples with very low bacillary loads. As programs expand active case-finding and early detection of asymptomatic disease, the proportion of TB detected with very low bacillary load will increase. Diagnostic algorithms require adjustments to prevent unnecessary RR-TB treatment.

10.1111/jcmm.70434	Machine Learning-Based Glycolipid Metabolism Gene Signature Predicts Prognosis and Immune Landscape in Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	Zhu L, Liang F, Han X, Ye B, Xue L	Using machine learning approaches, we developed and validated a novel prognostic model for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) based on glycolipid metabolism-related genes. Through integrated analysis of TCGA and GEO datasets, we established a robust 15-gene signature that effectively stratified patients into distinct risk groups. This signature demonstrated superior prognostic value and revealed significant associations with immune infiltration patterns. High-risk patients exhibited reduced immune cell infiltration, particularly in B cells and NK cells, alongside increased tumour purity. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis uncovered unique cellular composition patterns and enhanced interaction intensities in the high-risk group, especially within epithelial and smooth muscle cells. Functional validation confirmed MECP2 as a promising therapeutic target, with its knockdown significantly inhibiting tumour progression both in vitro and in vivo. Drug sensitivity analysis identified specific therapeutic agents showing potential efficacy for high-risk patients. Our study provides both a practical prognostic tool and novel insights into the relationship between glycolipid metabolism and tumour immunity in ESCC, offering potential strategies for personalised treatment.

Here we show that neurons in the medial vestibular nuclei parvocellular part (MVePC) mediate the hypothermic responses induced by motion. Reactivation of motion-sensitive MVePC neurons recapitulates motion sickness in mice. We show that motion-activated neurons in the MVePC are glutamatergic (MVePC(Glu)), and that optogenetic stimulation of MVePC(Glu) neurons mimics motion-induced hypothermia by signalling to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN). Acute inhibition of MVePC-LPBN circuitry abrogates motion-induced hypothermia. Finally, we show that chronic inhibition of MVePC(Glu) neurons prevents diet-induced obesity and improves glucose homeostasis without suppressing food intake. Overall, these findings highlight MVePC(Glu) neurons as a potential target for motion-sickness treatment and obesity control.

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), favored by diabetes and obesity, was shown to contribute to HFpEF pathophysiology and is an emerging therapeutic target. This study explored the relationship between ventricular EAT measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), metabolic factors, and imaging characteristics in controls, pre-HF patients, and HFpEF patients. METHODS: Patients from a Belgian cohort enrolled from December 2015 to June 2017 were categorized by HF stage: pre-HF (n = 16), HFpEF (n = 104) and compared to matched controls (n = 26) and to pre-HF (n = 191) from the Beta3-LVH cohort. Biventricular EAT volume was measured in end-diastolic short-axis cine stacks. In the Belgian cohort, associations between EAT, HF stage, and various biological and imaging markers were explored. The clinical endpoint was a composite of mortality or first HF hospitalization in the HFpEF group. RESULTS: EAT significantly differed between groups, with higher values in HFpEF patients compared to pre-HF and controls (72.4 ± 20.8ml/m(2)vs. 55.0 ± 11.8ml/m(2) and 48 ± 8.9ml/m(2), p < 0.001) from the Belgian cohort and to pre-HF (52.0 ± 15.0 ml/m(2), p < 0.001) from the Beta3-LVH cohort. Subsequent analyses focused on the Belgian cohort. In contrast to atrial fibrillation, diabetes prevalence and body mass index (BMI) did not differ between pre-HF and HFpEF patients. Multivariable logistic regression and random forest classification identified EAT, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and H(2)FPEF score as strong markers of HFpEF status. EAT was significantly correlated with H(2)FPEF score (r = 0.41, p = 0.003), BMI (r = 0.30, p < 0.001), high-sensitive troponin T (r = 0.41, p < 0.001), NT-proBNP (r = 0.37, p < 0.001), soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2 (sST2) (r = 0.30, p < 0.001), E/e' ratio (r = 0.33, p < 0.001), and left ventricular global longitudinal strain (r = 0.35, p < 0.001). In HFpEF patients, diabetes, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and elevated sST2 were independently associated with elevated EAT. In contrast with diabetes and BMI, increased EAT was not associated with prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: EAT assessed by CMR was significantly higher in HFpEF patients compared to controls and pre-HF patients, irrespective of diabetes and BMI. EAT was moderately associated with HFpEF status. HFpEF patients with elevated EAT exhibited a marked diabetic, ischemic, and inflammatory profile, highlighting the potential role of drugs targeting EAT.

He K, Dong X, Yang T, Li Z, Liu Y, He J, Wu M, Wei-Zhang S, Kaysar P, Cui B, Yao X, Zhang L, Zhou W, Xu H, Wei J, Liu Q, Hu J, Wang X, Yan H	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent neuroinflammation condition and the leading cause of irreversible blindness among the elderly population. Smoking significantly increases AMD risk, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of Sema4D-PlexinB1 axis in the progression of AMD, in which Sema4D-PlexinB1 is highly activated by smoking. Using patient-derived samples and mouse models, we discover that smoking increases the presence of Sema4D on the surface of CD8(+) T cells that migrate into the choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesion via CXCL12-CXCR4 axis and interact with its receptor PlexinB1 on choroidal pericytes. This leads to ROR2-mediated PlexinB1 phosphorylation and pericyte activation, thereby disrupting vascular homeostasis and promoting neovascularization. Inhibition of Sema4D reduces CNV and improves the benefit of anti-VEGF treatment. In conclusion, this study unveils the molecular mechanisms through which smoking exacerbates AMD pathology, and presents a potential therapeutic strategy by targeting Sema4D to augment current AMD treatments.

Su R, Wen W, Jin Y, Cao Z, Feng Z, Chen J, Lu Y, Zhou G, Dong C, Gao S, Li X, Zhang H, Chao K, Lan P, Wu X, Philips A, Li K, Gao X, Zhang F, Zuo T	BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome and diet are important factors in the pathogenesis and management of Crohn's disease (CD). However, the role of the gut phageome under dietary influences is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore the effect of diet on the gut phageome-bacteriome interaction linking to CD protection. DESIGN: We recruited CD patients and healthy subjects (n=140) and conducted a multiomics investigation, including paired ileal mucosa phageome and bacteriome profiling, dietary survey and phenome interrogation. We screened for the effect of diet on the gut phageome and bacteriome, as well as its epidemiological association with CD risks. The underlying mechanisms were explored in target phage-bacteria monocultures and cocultures in vitro and in two mouse models in vivo. RESULTS: On dietary screening in humans, whey protein (WP) consumption was found to profoundly impact the gut phageome and bacteriome (more pronounced on the phageome) and was associated with a lower CD risk. Indeed, the WP reshaped gut phageome can causally attenuate intestinal inflammation, as shown by faecal phageome versus bacteriome transplantation from WP-consuming versus WP-non-consuming mice to recipient mice. Mechanistically, WP induced phage (a newly isolated phage AkkZT003P herein) lysis of the mucin-foraging bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila, which unleashed the symbiotic bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus to counteract intestinal inflammation. CONCLUSION: Our study charted the importance of cross-kingdom interaction between gut phage and bacteria in mediating the dietary effect on CD protection. Importantly, we uncovered a beneficial dietary WP, a keystone phage AkkZT003P, and a probiotic S. thermophilus that can be used in CD management in the future.

10.1038/s41419-025-07498-z	Histone lactylation enhances GCLC expression and thus promotes chemoresistance of colorectal cancer stem cells through inhibiting ferroptosis.	Deng J, Li Y, Yin L, Liu S, Li Y, Liao W, Mu L, Luo X, Qin J	Colorectal cancer stem cells (CCSCs) play a critical role in mediating chemoresistance. Lactylation is a post-translational modification induced by lactate that regulates gene expression. However, whether lactylation affects the chemoresistance of CCSCs remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that histone lactylation enhances CCSC chemoresistance both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, our findings showed that p300 catalyzes the lactylation of histone H4 at K12, whereas HDAC1 facilitates its delactylation in CCSCs. Notably, lactylation at H4K12 (H4K12la) upregulates GCLC expression and inhibits ferroptosis in CCSCs, and the inhibition of p300 or LDHA decreases H4K12la levels, thereby increasing the chemosensitivity of CCSCs. Additionally, the GCLC inhibitor BSO promotes ferroptosis and sensitizes CCSCs to oxaliplatin. Taken together, these findings suggest that histone lactylation upregulates GCLC to inhibit ferroptosis signaling, thus enhancing CCSC chemoresistance. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between cellular metabolism and chemoresistance and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting p300, LDHA, and GCLC. We showed that histones H4K12 lactylation promoted chemoresistance in CSCs. p300 catalyzes the lactylation of histone H4 at K12, HDAC1 inhibits the histone lactylation at the same site. H4K12la in CSCs regulates the expression of the ferroptosis-related gene GCLC, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis and leading to chemoresistance. Targeting the p300, LDHA, or GCLC may be overcome tumor chemoresistance.

The mechanisms underlying this effect remain elusive. Here, in vivo genome-wide CRISPR screening identifies SFRP2 as a potential stromal regulator of the abscopal effect. SFRP2 exhibits cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-specific expression and radioimmunotherapy-mediated upregulation in unirradiated tumors. Conditional Sfrp2 knockout in CAFs boosts the abscopal effect by rewiring the vascular-immune microenvironment to promote CD8(+) T cell recruitment to unirradiated tumors. In vivo lineage tracing reveals that elevated SFRP2 correlates with radioimmunotherapy-driven pericyte lineage commitment. Serum proteomics reveals that irradiated-tumor-secreted PAI-1 triggers distant tumor pericyte cell-fate transition into SFRP2(high) CAFs via the LRP1/p65 axis. Pharmacologically blocking SFRP2 or PAI-1 enhances the abscopal effect in humanized patient-derived xenograft models. Our findings collectively illustrate that PAI-1-induced SFRP2(high) CAFs serve as critical stromal regulator to hijack the abscopal effect, providing promising targets for enhancing radioimmunotherapy effectiveness.

10.1016/j.jprot.2021.104190	Chronic restraint stress induced changes in colonic homeostasis-related indexes and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in rats.	Li CC, Gan L, Tan Y, Yan MZ, Liu XM, Chang Q, Pan RL	Chronic stressors represented risk factors for the etiology or exacerbation of several gastrointestinal diseases. The goal of the present study was to examine whether chronic restraint stress (CRS) could initiate and aggravate colonic inflammation, integrity damage and metabolic disturbance of rats. Firstly, increased inflammatory cytokines (interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) and interleukin-10(IL-10)) and decreased tight junction (TJ) proteins (occludin and zonula occludins-1 (ZO-1)) in rat colon were observed. Secondly, untargeted metabolomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) revealed that TRP metabolism was the most prominently affected. Thirdly, quantification of TRP and its metabolites via prominence ultrafast liquid chromatography coupled with a QTRAP 5500 mass (UFLC-QTRAP-5500/MS) showed that TRP, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KA) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) were significantly increased. At the same time, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was unchanged and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) was significantly decreased in the colon of CRS rats. Besides, TRP metabolic enzyme changes were with the same trends as the corresponding metabolites. Thus, our data showed that CRS could initiate colonic inflammation, integrity damage and colonic metabolism disturbance, especially TRP-KYN metabolism pathway of rats, which may provide an experimental background for future research on stress-related gastrointestinal dysfunction. SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic exposure to psychological stress could induce metabolic imbalance of the body, and stressful life events were intimately correlated with frequent relapses in patients with intestinal disorders. The present study showed that chronic restraint stress (CRS) could initiate and aggravate colonic inflammation, integrity damage and metabolic disturbance, especially tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism of rats. Tryptophan-kynurenine pathway may be involved in the initiation and development of diseases induced by chronic stress.

Chang Y, Wang N, Li S, Zhang J, Rao Y, Xu Z, Li L, Wu H, Chen J, Lin Y, Huang X, Liu P, Zhang J, Liao Y, Lin C, Huang C, Xia N	Abnormal amino acid metabolism supports cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and immune evasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous research exploring amino acid metabolism in HCC has primarily focused on how metabolic reprogramming impacts tumor cells. Here, we focused on the role of amino acid metabolism dysregulation in the crosstalk between HCC and T cells. HCC cells disrupted lysine uptake in T cells, leading to impaired T cell immunity. Lysine deprivation decreased STAT3 levels in T cells, inhibiting T cell proliferation and effector function and ultimately promoting tumor progression. Mechanistically, HCC cells outcompeted T cells for lysine by expressing high levels of the lysine transporter SLC3A2. Clinically, elevated SLC3A2 expression correlated with poor survival and was linked to dysregulated T cell functional gene signatures in HCC patients. Furthermore, the multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib induced a c-Myc-SLC3A2 regulatory axis that limited the efficacy of lenvatinib treatment. Lysine supplementation enhanced tumor sensitivity to combined treatment with lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. These findings suggest that lysine supplementation is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating HCC and enhancing the sensitivity of HCC to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade.

Rozera T, Pasolli E, Segata N, Ianiro G	The gut microbiome is involved in human health and disease, and its comprehensive understanding is necessary to exploit it as a diagnostic or therapeutic tool. Multi-omics approaches, including metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and metaproteomics, enable depicting the complexity of the gut microbial ecosystem. However, these tools generate a large data stream, which integration is needed to produce clinically useful readouts but, in turn, might be difficult to carry out with conventional statistical methods. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been increasingly applied to multi-omics datasets in several conditions associated with microbiome disruption, from chronic disorders to cancer. Such tools show potential for clinical implementation, including the discovery of microbial biomarkers for disease classification or prediction, the prediction of response to specific treatments, the fine-tuning of microbiome-modulating therapies.

10.1186/s12887-025-05592-x	Validity and reliability of the European health literacy child form in Turkish children.	Altunoz I, Aygun O	PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the European Health Literacy Scale Child Form in Turkish children and to examine the instrument's psychometric properties. DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 843 students aged 9-11 years in primary and secondary school were included in this scale adaptation study. In the validity analyses of the Health Literacy Scale Child Form-Turkish form (HLS-Child-Q15-TR), language and content validity were used to determine cultural compatibility, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were used in structural analyses. Reliability was investigated by examining internal consistency and test-retest reliability. RESULTS: The content validity of the HLS-Child-Q15-TR was found to be high. The model fit values of the confirmatory factor analysis results of the three-factor model consisting of health care, disease prevention and health promotion dimensions of the HLS-Child-Q15-TR were found to be satisfactory (x2/df = 2.68, CFI = 0.945, GFI = 0.965, and RMSEA = 0.045). HLS-Child-Q15-TR item-total correlations were above 0.30 and Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.831. The test-retest correlation coefficient of the HLS-Child-Q15-TR was 0.98 and stable over time. CONCLUSIONS: HLS-Child-Q15-TR is valid and reliable in Turkish children aged 9-11 years. It is recommended that the valid and reliable HLS-Child-Q15-TR be used to measure the health literacy levels of Turkish children under 12 years of age.

10.1186/s12933-025-02625-8	Piezo1 deletion mitigates diabetic cardiomyopathy by maintaining mitochondrial dynamics via ERK/Drp1 pathway.	Niu W, Liu X, Deng B, Hong T, Wang C, Yan Y, Liu J, Jiang Y, Li J	OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence highlights the critical role of Piezo1 in cardiovascular diseases, with its expression upregulated in diabetic heart. However, the involvement of Piezo1 in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the regulatory role of Piezo1 in mitochondrial dynamics within the context of DCM and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We constructed cardiac-specific knockout of Piezo1 (Piezo1(∆Myh6)) mice. Type 1 diabetes was induced using streptozotocin (STZ) injection while type 2 diabetes was established through a high-fat diet combined with STZ. Echocardiography assessed left ventricular function, histological evaluations used HE and Masson staining to examine cardiac pathology in Piezo1(fl/fl) controls, Piezo1(∆Myh6) controls, Piezo1(fl/fl) diabetic and Piezo1(∆Myh6) diabetic mice. Mitochondrial function including oxygen species level, mitochondrial morphology, and respiration rate were also assessed. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that Piezo1 expression was upregulated in the myocardium of diabetic mice and in high-glucose-treated cells. Cardiac-specific knockout of Piezo1 improved cardiac dysfunction and ameliorated cardiac fibrosis in diabetic mice. Moreover, Piezo1 deficiency also attenuated mitochondrial impairment. Piezo1(fl/fl) diabetic mice exhibited increased calpain activity and excessive mitochondrial fission mediated by Drp1 and obvious reduced fusion; however, Piezo1 deficiency restored calpain levels and mitochondrial dysfunction. These observations were also corroborated in H9C2 cells and neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. Cardiac-specific knockout of Piezo1 increased phosphorylation of Drp1 and ERK1/2 in vivo and in vitro. Piezo1 knockout or treatment with inhibitor improved mitochondrial function. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that Piezo1 is elevated in DCM through the modulation of mitochondrial dynamics, which is reversed by Piezo1 deficiency. Thus, Piezo1 inhibition may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of DCM.

Huang S, Pan L, Pang S, Guo H, Li M, Tian Y, Shi W, Liu B, Wang S, Fan Z, Zong Y, Tian D, Zhang D	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Approximately 25.2% of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients suffer from psychological disorders, particularly depression. Recent studies have indicated a close relationship between intestinal immunity and brain disorders. METHODS: We performed transcriptome analysis and immunofluorescence staining of colonic samples from IBD patients. The role of perforin generated by colonic CD8(+) T cells in IBD-induced depression was investigated in DSS- and CD8(+) T-cell transfer-induced colitis by using Prf1-EGFP reporter and Prf1 knockout mice. RESULTS: In this study, we revealed a significant correlation between depressive symptom severity and perforin production in CD8(+) T cells in both IBD patients and mice with colitis. Moreover, perforin deficiency in CD8(+) T cells mitigated both inflammation and depressive-like behaviors in mice with colitis. Mechanistically, perforin and granzyme B were found to stimulate the expression of CXCL9 in colonic epithelial cells. CXCL9 was shown to be released into the circulation and to enter the hippocampus, where it induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hippocampal neurons through the CXCR3-HSPA5 axis. This cascade of events subsequently was found to exacerbate depression. Neutralizing CXCL9 in vivo alleviated depression but had no effect on colitis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Perforin generated by colonic CD8(+) T cells promotes intestinal epithelial cell CXCL9 production, which leads to neuronal ER stress in hippocampus and induces depression in IBD.

Li H, Bao S, Farzad N, Qin X, Fung AA, Zhang D, Bai Z, Tao B, Fan R	The epigenome of a cell is tightly correlated with gene transcription, which controls cell identity and diverse biological activities. Recent advances in spatial technologies have improved our understanding of tissue heterogeneity by analyzing transcriptomics or epigenomics with spatial information preserved, but have been mainly restricted to one molecular layer at a time. Here we present procedures for two spatially resolved sequencing methods, spatial-ATAC-RNA-seq and spatial-CUT&Tag-RNA-seq, that co-profile transcriptome and epigenome genome wide. In both methods, transcriptomic readouts are generated through tissue fixation, permeabilization and in situ reverse transcription. In spatial-ATAC-RNA-seq, Tn5 transposase is used to probe accessible chromatin, and in spatial-CUT&Tag-RNA-seq, the tissue is incubated with primary antibodies that target histone modifications, followed by Protein A-fused Tn5-induced tagmentation. Both methods leverage a microfluidic device that delivers two sets of oligonucleotide barcodes to generate a two-dimensional mosaic of tissue pixels at near single-cell resolution. A spatial-ATAC-RNA-seq or spatial-CUT&Tag-RNA-seq library can be generated in 3-5 d, allowing researchers to simultaneously investigate the transcriptomic landscape and epigenomic landscape of an intact tissue section. This protocol is an extension of our previous spatially resolved epigenome sequencing protocol and provides opportunities in multimodal profiling.

Here we identify mutations in TET2 as the most common co-occurring mutation in TP53 mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. In mice, combined hematopoietic-specific deletion of TET2 and TP53 resulted in enhanced self-renewal compared to deletion of either gene alone. Tp53/Tet2 double knockout mice developed serially transplantable AML. Both mice and AML patients with combined TET2/TP53 alterations upregulated innate immune signaling in malignant granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), which had leukemia-initiating capacity. A20 governs the leukemic maintenance by triggering aberrant non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Mice with Tp53/Tet2 loss had expansion of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which impaired T cell proliferation and activation. Moreover, mice and AML patients with combined TP53/TET2 alterations displayed increased expression of the TIGIT ligand, CD155, on malignant cells. TIGIT blocking antibodies augmented NK cell-mediated killing of Tp53/Tet2 double-mutant AML cells, reduced leukemic burden, and prolonged survival in Tp53/Tet2 double knockout mice.

10.1186/s12933-025-02684-x	Impact of glycemic control metrics on short- and long-term mortality in transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients: a retrospective cohort study from the MIMIC-IV database.	Yu Q, Fu Q, Ma X, Wang H, Xia Y, Chen Y, Li P, Li Y, Wu Y	BACKGROUND: Glycemic control is critical for managing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients, especially those in intensive care units (ICUs). Emerging metrics such as the hemoglobin glycation index (HGI), stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), and glycemic variability (GV) offer advanced insights into glucose metabolism. However, their prognostic implications for short- and long-term outcomes post-TAVR remain underexplored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 3342 ICU-admitted TAVR patients via the MIMIC-IV database. Patients were stratified into tertiles for HGI, SHR, and GV levels. Survival analyses, including Kaplan‒Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines (RCSs), were used to assess associations between glycemic control metrics and 30-day and 365-day all-cause mortality in these patients. Sensitivity analyses, subgroup assessments, and external validation were also performed to verify the study findings. RESULTS: During follow-up, 1.6% and 6.9% of patients experienced 30-day and 365-day mortality after TAVR, respectively. In the fully adjusted cox regression model, lower HGI (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.05-2.09, P = 0.025) and higher SHR (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15-2.32, P = 0.006) were most significantly associated with an increased risk of 365-day mortality. Higher SHR was also significantly associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality in patients (HR 2.92, 95% CI 1.32-6.45, P = 0.008). Both lower (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38-0.92, P = 0.019) and higher GV levels (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.06-1.93, P = 0.020) were associated with the risk of 365-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill TAVR patients, glycemic control metrics are closely associated with long-term all-cause mortality. The HGI, SHR, and GV provide prognostic insights into clinical outcomes that surpass conventional glucose measurements. These findings highlight the importance of personalized glycemic management strategies in improving TAVR patient outcomes.	Cardiovascular diabetology	22/03/2025	Impact of glycemic control metrics on short- and long-term mortality in transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients: a retrospective cohort study from the MIMIC-IV database.. BACKGROUND: Glycemic control is critical for managing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients, especially those in intensive care units (ICUs). Emerging metrics such as the hemoglobin glycation index (HGI), stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), and glycemic variability (GV) offer advanced insights into glucose metabolism. However, their prognostic implications for short- and long-term outcomes post-TAVR remain underexplored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 3342 ICU-admitted TAVR patients via the MIMIC-IV database. Patients were stratified into tertiles for HGI, SHR, and GV levels. Survival analyses, including Kaplan‒Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines (RCSs), were used to assess associations between glycemic control metrics and 30-day and 365-day all-cause mortality in these patients. Sensitivity analyses, subgroup assessments, and external validation were also performed to verify the study findings. RESULTS: During follow-up, 1.6% and 6.9% of patients experienced 30-day and 365-day mortality after TAVR, respectively. In the fully adjusted cox regression model, lower HGI (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.05-2.09, P = 0.025) and higher SHR (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15-2.32, P = 0.006) were most significantly associated with an increased risk of 365-day mortality.

10.1016/j.jhep.2025.03.008	Effect of albumin treatment duration on response rates and outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury.	Schleicher EM, Karbannek H, Weinmann-Menke J, Galle PR, Stallmach A, Gairing SJ, Zipprich A, Ripoll C, Labenz C	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Guidelines recommended volume expansion with albumin for 48 hours for patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury (AKI) to correct hypovolemia and rule out prerenal AKI. A recent update in the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI)-International Club of Ascites (ICA) consensus guidelines suggested shortening this duration to 24 hours, primarily based on expert opinion. This study aimed to evaluate the response rates to albumin treatment after 24 and 48 hours and to compare and assess the prognostic significance of three different definitions of response to albumin therapy. METHODS: Data from 127 prospectively recruited patients with cirrhosis and AKI from two German centers were analyzed. We examined three response definitions after 24 and 48 hours: (1) serum creatinine (SCr) decrease > 0.3 mg/dl, (2) SCr decrease >25 %, and (3) SCr decrease in at least one AKI stage. Follow-up was prolonged until liver transplantation, death or hemodialysis (HD). RESULTS: Overall, 30-54 % of the patients responded to albumin treatment depending on the definition, and response rates were balanced across AKI stages. Notably, a relevant number of patients who responded at 48 hours did not respond within the first 24 hours. Additional response to albumin during the second 24 hours were 38 %, 24 %, and 25 % (definitions 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Response according to definition 3 was associated with a better HD- and transplantation-free survival. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of patients requires 48 hours to respond to albumin treatment. Shortening time of albumin therapy may lead to overtreatment with terlipressin. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This study provides valuable insights into the optimal duration of albumin treatment for patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury (AKI), challenging the recent recommendation of shortening the treatment period with albumin. Furthermore, the optimal definition for response to albumin (reduction of at least one AKI stage) has been assessed. The results of this study are highly clinically relevant since shortening albumin therapy may lead to overtreatment with terlipressin, and evidence to support the choice of the definition of response to albumin was lacking. Clinicians can use these findings to predict treatment outcomes better, avoid fluid overload, and improve patient prognosis while also considering the potential risks of early intervention with terlipressin.

To unlock the potential of EHR data to improve patient health, public health, and health care, it is essential to streamline the exchange of health data. As leaders across the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), we describe how DHHS has implemented fundamental building blocks to achieve this vision. OBSERVATIONS: Across DHHS, we have implemented 3 foundational building blocks called for by the 2016 21st Century Cures Act to create a unified approach for secure, high-quality, and timely exchange of health data across the health care system. The United States Core Data for Interoperability provides a minimum baseline for data elements that must be available in federally regulated health information technology systems such as certified EHRs. These data elements now must be accessible using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources-a secure, flexible, and open-industry standard for health data exchange. The Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement provides a network to securely exchange health data across the country. The 3 building blocks of United States Core Data for Interoperability, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, and Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement are now in place thanks to diligent public and private sector work over 2 administrations. Across DHHS, we are working to refine these building blocks and increase their adoption through regulatory authorities, grants, and public-private partnerships. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The technological building blocks described in this article are creating a unified approach to health data exchange for patient access, clinical care, quality improvement, scientific research, public health, and other uses of health data. Collaborations between the public, nonprofit, and private sectors are needed to maximize their potential. By unlocking the potential of health data, these building blocks are the foundation of a 21st-century digital health care system that will improve the experience of patients and clinicians and result in better health outcomes.

10.1038/s41586-025-08873-8	Structures and mechanism of human mitochondrial pyruvate carrier.	Liang J, Shi J, Song A, Lu M, Zhang K, Xu M, Huang G, Lu P, Wu X, Ma D	Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein complex essential for uptake of pyruvate into matrix as the primary carbon source for tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle(1,2). Here, we report six cryo-EM structures of human MPC in three different states: three structures obtained at different conditions in intermembrane space (IMS)-open state with highest resolution of 3.2 Å, a structure of pyruvate-treated MPC in occluded state at 3.7 Å, and two structures in matrix-facing state bound with the inhibitor UK5099 or an inhibitory nanobody on the matrix side at 3.2 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively. MPC is assigned into a heterodimer consisting of MPC1 and MPC2, with the transmembrane domain adopting pseudo-C2-symmetry. Approximate rigid body movements occur between the IMS-open state and the occluded state, while structural changes primarily on the matrix side facilitate the transition between the occluded state and the matrix-facing state, revealing the alternating access mechanism during pyruvate transport. In the UK5099-bound structure, the inhibitor fits well and interacts extensively with a pocket that opens to the matrix side. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying MPC-mediated substrate transport, and the recognition and inhibition by UK5099, which will facilitate future drug development targeting MPC.

10.1002/cac2.70021	Immunosuppressive JAG2(+) tumor-associated neutrophils hamper PD-1 blockade response in ovarian cancer by mediating the differentiation of effector regulatory T cells.	Wang C, Yang M, Zhong Y, Cao K, Wang X, Zhang C, Wang Y, He M, Lu J, Zhang G, Huang Y, Liu H	BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) play a critical role in modulating immune responses and exhibit significant heterogeneity. Our previous study demonstrated that jagged canonical Notch ligand 2 (JAG2)(+) TANs were associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of JAG2(+) TANs in tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment in HGSOC. METHODS: HGSOC samples were collected, with 274 samples constituting two independent cohorts (training and validation cohorts) and an additional 30 samples utilized to establish patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs). We characterized the number and phenotype of JAG2(+) TANs by multiplex immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We investigated the biological functions of JAG2 in immune evasion using in vitro co-culture systems, flow cytometry, tumor-bearing mouse models, and PDTOs. RESULTS: JAG2(+) TANs expressed elevated levels of immunosuppressive molecules, including programmed cell death ligand 1 and CD14, and had independent prognostic value for the overall survival of patients with HGSOC. scRNA-seq analysis revealed that JAG2(+) TANs exhibited a terminally mature phenotype. The infiltration of JAG2(+) TANs was positively correlated with the abundance of effector regulatory T cells (eTregs). Interaction with JAG2(+) TANs skewed CD4(+) T cells towards an eTreg phenotype, a process that was suppressed by the Notch inhibitor LY3039478 and induced by recombinant Jagged2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that JAG2(+) TANs enhanced Notch signaling activation, ultimately promoting recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ)-induced differentiation of naïve CD4(+) T cells into eTregs. Clinically, JAG2(+) TANs could serve as a biomarker for assessing immunotherapy resistance in various solid tumors. Pharmacological targeting of Notch signaling with LY3039478 or JAG2 neutralization antibodies enhanced the efficacy of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in both xenograft and PDTO models. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of JAG2(+) TANs is crucial for the differentiation of eTregs, which triggers immune evasion and resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Inhibiting Notch signaling with LY3039478 or JAG2 neutralization antibodies may overcome this anti-PD-1 resistance in HGSOC.

10.1080/07853890.2025.2478477	Association of thrombocytopenia and D-dimer elevation with in-hospital mortality in acute aortic dissection.	He X, Balati A, Wang W, Wang H, Zhang B, Li C, Yu D, Guo S, Zeng H	BACKGROUND: Data on the association between the degree of platelet and coagulative-fibrinolytic variables abnormalities and the risk of in-hospital mortality in acute aortic dissection (AAD) are limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicentre retrospective cohort study included patients diagnosed with AAD by aortic computed tomographic angiography between 2010 and 2021 in five tertiary hospitals in China. The primary outcome was defined as all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Associations between platelet counts, coagulation-fibrinolytic parameters and all-cause in-hospital mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Among the 2567 participants, the median age was 54 years (interquartile range, IQR: 47-63); 531 (20.7%) were female, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 589 (23.0%). The Cox proportional hazards regression model indicated that lower platelet count, prothrombin activity (PTA), and fibrinogen levels and longer prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT) were linearly positively associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality (p < 0.05). A non-linear and positive association was confirmed between D-dimer levels and in-hospital mortality risk (p < 0.05). Additionally, a significant interaction between platelet counts and D-dimer levels was observed (p = 0.029). According to the subgroup analysis, compared to those in the reference group, those with thrombocytopenia (<140 × 10(9)/L) and high D-dimer levels (>14.6 µg/mL) had a 3.59-fold increased risk of in-hospital mortality (HR, 3.59; 95% CI, 2.00-6.42). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed associations between changes in platelet count, PT, PTA, TT, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels and outcomes in patients with AAD. Furthermore, the combined effect of thrombocytopenia and high D-dimer levels significantly increased the risk of in-hospital mortality.

This study aimed to describe the use of ICS in patients with bronchiectasis across Europe. METHODS: Patients with bronchiectasis were enrolled into the European Bronchiectasis Registry from 2015 to 2022. Patients were grouped into ICS users and non-users at baseline and clinical characteristics associated with ICS use were investigated. Patients were followed up for clinical outcomes of exacerbation, hospitalisation and mortality for up to 5 years. We evaluated if elevated blood eosinophil counts (above the laboratory upper limit of normal) modified the effect of ICS on exacerbations. RESULTS: 19 324 patients were included for analysis and 10 109 (52.3%) were recorded as being prescribed ICS at baseline. After exclusion of patients with a history of asthma, COPD and/or ABPA, 3174/9715 (32.7%) patients with bronchiectasis were prescribed ICS. Frequency of ICS use varied across countries, ranging from 17% to 85% of included patients. ICS users had more severe disease, with significantly worse lung function, higher Bronchiectasis Severity Index scores and more frequent exacerbations at baseline (p<0.0001). Overall, ICS users did not have a reduced risk of exacerbation or hospitalisation during follow-up, but a significant reduction in exacerbation frequency was observed in the subgroup of ICS users with elevated blood eosinophil counts (relative risk 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.84, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: ICS use is common in bronchiectasis, including in those not currently recommended ICS according to bronchiectasis guidelines. ICS use may be associated with reduced exacerbation frequency in patients with elevated blood eosinophils.

Huang L, Lu Y, He R, Guo X, Zhou J, Fu Z, Li J, Liu J, Chen R, Zhou Y, Zhou Q	BACKGROUND: Perineural invasion (PNI) is a hallmark feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which occurs at a high incidence and significantly contributes to PDAC lethality and poor survival. Despite its prevalence and association with poor prognosis, the molecular mechanisms underlying PNI in PDAC remain unclear. METHODS: We investigated clinical samples from two cohorts by UPLC/MS-MS to profiled significantly altered chemical RNA modifications in PDAC tissues with PNI lesions. Dorsal root ganglion coculture systems and sciatic nerve injection models validated PNI ability. We combined RNA-seq, acRIP-seq and ac4C-seq with CRISPR-based techniques to explore the regulatory mechanism of ac4C modification on the integrin beta 5 (ITGB5) transcript. RESULT: We reported that N(4)-acetylcytidine (ac4C) is a significantly altered chemical RNA modification in PDAC tissues with PNI lesions. In vitro and in vivo models demonstrated that tumor cells overexpression of N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), the writer enzyme of mRNA ac4C modification, enhances PNI in PDAC. Further analysis revealed decreased ac4C levels on transcripts of the focal adhesion pathway, particular on ITGB5, in NAT10-knockdown PDAC cells. This ac4C modification in the CDS region of ITGB5 mRNA promotes its stability, subsequently activating the ITGB5-pFAK-pSrc pathway. CRISPR-based analysis further confirmed the crucial role of NAT10-mediated ac4C modification in regulating ITGB5 expression. Combining small-molecule inhibitors targeting NAT10 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) significantly attenuated PNI in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized ac4C-mediated epigenetic mechanism in PNI and propose a novel therapeutic strategy to improve survival in PDAC patients.

Zhong C, Li W, Zhang X, Zhang D, Wen Z, Song W, Jiang Z, Gao Z, Guo H, Bi G, Liu Z, Li D, Dinesh-Kumar SP, Zhang Y	Plants deploy intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeats (NLRs) to detect pathogen effectors and initiate immune responses. Although the activation mechanism of some plant NLRs forming resistosomes has been elucidated, whether NLR resistosome assembly is regulated to fine-tune immunity remains enigmatic. Here we used an antiviral coiled coil-nucleotide-binding site-leucine rich repeat, Barley Stripe Resistance 1 (BSR1), as a model and demonstrate that BSR1 is phosphorylated. Using a proximity labelling approach, we identified a wall-associated kinase-like protein 20 (WAKL20) which negatively regulates BSR1-mediated immune responses by directly phosphorylating the Ser470 residue in the NB-ARC domain of BSR1. Mechanistically, Ser470 phosphorylation results in a steric clash of intramolecular domains of BSR1, thereby compromising BSR1 oligomerization. The phosphorylation site is conserved among multiple plant NLRs and our results show that WAKL20 participates in other NLR-mediated immune responses besides BSR1. Together, our data reveal phosphorylation as a mechanism for modulating plant resistosome assembly, and provide new insight into NLR-mediated plant immunity.

10.1016/S2215-0366(25)00028-8	Clinical and cost-effectiveness of lithium versus quetiapine augmentation for treatment-resistant depression: a pragmatic, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled superiority trial in the UK.	Cleare AJ, Kerr-Gaffney J, Goldsmith K, Zenasni Z, Yaziji N, Jin H, Colasanti A, Geddes JR, Kessler D, McAllister-Williams RH, Young AH, Barrera A, Marwood L, Taylor RW, Tee H	BACKGROUND: Lithium and quetiapine are first-line augmentation options for treatment-resistant depression; however, few studies have compared them directly, and none for longer than 8 weeks. We aimed to assess whether quetiapine augmentation therapy is more clinically effective and cost-effective than lithium for patients with treatment-resistant depression over 12 months. METHODS: We did this pragmatic, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled superiority trial at six National Health Service trusts in England. Eligible participants were adults (aged ≥18 years) with a current episode of major depressive disorder meeting DSM-5 criteria, with a score of 14 or higher on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at screening who had responded inadequately to two or more therapeutic antidepressant trials. Exclusion criteria included having a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or current psychosis. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to the decision to prescribe lithium or quetiapine, stratified by site, depression severity, and treatment resistance, using block randomisation with randomly varying block sizes. After randomisation, pre-prescribing safety checks were undertaken as per standard care before proceeding to trial medication initiation. The coprimary outcomes were depressive symptom severity over 12 months, measured weekly using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and time to all-cause treatment discontinuation. Economic analyses compared the cost-effectiveness of the two treatments from both an NHS and personal social services perspective, and a societal perspective. Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned participants. People with lived experience were involved in the trial. The trial is completed and registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry, ISRCTN16387615. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2016, and July 26, 2021, 212 participants (97 [46%] male gender and 115 [54%] female gender) were randomly assigned to the decision to prescribe quetiapine (n=107) or lithium (n=105). The mean age of participants was 42·4 years (SD 14·0 years) and 188 (89%) of 212 participants were White, seven (3%) were of mixed ethnicity, nine (4%) participants were Asian, four (2%) were Black, three (1%) were of Other ethnicity, and ethnicity was not recorded for one (1%) participant. Participants in the quetiapine group had a significantly lower overall burden of depressive symptom severity than participants in the lithium group (area under the between-group differences curve -68·36 [95% CI -129·95 to -6·76; p=0·0296). Time to discontinuation did not significantly differ between the two groups. Quetiapine was more cost-effective than lithium. 32 serious adverse events were recorded in 18 participants, one of which was deemed possibly related to the trial medication in a female participant in the lithium group. The most common serious adverse event was overdose, occurring in three (3%) of 107 participants in the quetiapine group (seven events) and three (3%) of 105 participants in the lithium group (five events). INTERPRETATION: Results of the trial suggest that quetiapine is more clinically effective than lithium as a first-line augmentation option for reducing symptoms of depression in the long-term management of treatment-resistant depression, and is probably more cost-effective than lithium.

Using three-dimensional electron microscopy, we performed nanoscale reconstructions of the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway after chemogenetic labeling of cellular ensembles recruited during associative learning. Neurons with a remote history of activity coinciding with memory acquisition showed no strong preference for wiring with each other. Instead, their connectomes expanded through multisynaptic boutons independently of the coactivation state of postsynaptic partners. The rewiring of ensembles representing an initial engram was accompanied by input-specific, spatially restricted upscaling of individual synapses, as well as remodeling of mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and interactions with astrocytes. Our findings elucidate the physical hallmarks of long-term memory and offer a structural basis for the cellular flexibility of information coding.

Pang K, Liu X, Yao H, Lin G, Kong Y, Li A, Han J, Wu G, Wang X, Ye Y, Zhang J, Chen G, Wu A, Xiao Y, Yang Y, Zhang Z	BACKGROUND: The addition of PD1 blockade to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been shown to significantly increase pCR rates in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Yet, its impact on total mesorectal excision (TME) remains unknown. METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of the randomized POLARSTAR trial, which enrolled patients with LARC at eight major colorectal cancer centres in Beijing to compare neoadjuvant CRT plus PD1 blockade with CRT alone, was undertaken. Patients received one of three combinations of neoadjuvant treatments before TME surgery: CRT plus concurrent PD1 blockade (concurrent group), CRT plus sequential PD1 blockade (sequential group), and CRT alone (control group). Several parameters related to TME surgery were studied. RESULTS: For the concurrent group, the sequential group, and the control group, 52, 46, and 45 patients respectively were included in this analysis. The proportion of patients undergoing sphincter-saving plus one-stage anastomosis surgery was 92% (48 of 52), 96% (44 of 46), and 87% (39 of 45) respectively. The proportion of patients without a stoma was 21% (11 of 52), 17% (8 of 46), and 11% (5 of 45) respectively. The grade 3/4 surgical complication rate was 4% (2 of 52), 7% (3 of 46), and 4% (2 of 45) respectively. Significant differences were observed between the sequential group and the control group with respect to the proportion of patients with TRG0 (37% versus 18% respectively; P = 0.040), ypT0/is ypN0 (39% versus 20% respectively; P = 0.046), and a low neoadjuvant rectal (NAR) score (54% versus 31% respectively; P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant CRT plus PD1 blockade enhances pathological tumour regression and is beneficial to the successful implementation of TME in patients with LARC. Validations with larger sample sizes are warranted.	The British journal of surgery	04/03/2025	Impact of PD1 blockade added to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on rectal cancer surgery: post-hoc analysis of the randomized POLARSTAR trial.. BACKGROUND: The addition of PD1 blockade to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been shown to significantly increase pCR rates in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Yet, its impact on total mesorectal excision (TME) remains unknown. METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of the randomized POLARSTAR trial, which enrolled patients with LARC at eight major colorectal cancer centres in Beijing to compare neoadjuvant CRT plus PD1 blockade with CRT alone, was undertaken. Patients received one of three combinations of neoadjuvant treatments before TME surgery: CRT plus concurrent PD1 blockade (concurrent group), CRT plus sequential PD1 blockade (sequential group), and CRT alone (control group). Several parameters related to TME surgery were studied. RESULTS: For the concurrent group, the sequential group, and the control group, 52, 46, and 45 patients respectively were included in this analysis. The proportion of patients undergoing sphincter-saving plus one-stage anastomosis surgery was 92% (48 of 52), 96% (44 of 46), and 87% (39 of 45) respectively. The proportion of patients without a stoma was 21% (11 of 52), 17% (8 of 46), and 11% (5 of 45) respectively. The grade 3/4 surgical complication rate was 4% (2 of 52), 7% (3 of 46), and 4% (2 of 45) respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant CRT plus PD1 blockade enhances pathological tumour regression and is beneficial to the successful implementation of TME in patients with LARC.

Merkenschlager J, Pyo AGT, Silva Santos GS, Schaefer-Babajew D, Cipolla M, Hartweger H, Gitlin AD, Wingreen NS, Nussenzweig MC	Germinal centres are specialized microenvironments where B cells undergo affinity maturation. B cells expressing antibodies whose affinity is improved by somatic hypermutation are selected for expansion by limiting numbers of T follicular helper cells. Cell division is accompanied by mutation of the immunoglobulin genes, at what is believed to be a fixed rate of around 1 × 10(-3) per base pair per cell division(1). As mutagenesis is random, the probability of acquiring deleterious mutations outweighs the probability of acquiring affinity-enhancing mutations. This effect might be heightened, and even become counterproductive, in B cells that express high-affinity antibodies and undergo the greatest number of cell divisions(2). Here we experimentally examine a theoretical model that explains how affinity maturation could be optimized by varying the rate of somatic hypermutation such that cells that express higher-affinity antibodies divide more but mutate less per division. Data obtained from mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or a model antigen align with the theoretical model and show that cells producing high-affinity antibodies shorten the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle and reduce their mutation rates. We propose that these mechanisms safeguard high-affinity B cell lineages and enhance the outcomes of antibody affinity maturation.

Zhou J, He M, Zhao Q, Shi E, Wang H, Ponkshe V, Song J, Wu Z, Ji D, Kranz G, Tscherne A, Schwenk-Zieger S, Razak NA, Hess J, Belka C, Zitzelsberger H, Ourailidis I, Stögbauer F, Boxberg M, Budczies J, Reichel CA, Canis M, Baumeister P, Wang H, Unger K, Mock A, Gires O	BACKGROUND: Recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M-HNSCC) is a severe, frequently lethal condition. Oncogene addiction to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a hallmark of HNSCC, but the clinical efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapies remains low. Understanding molecular networks governing EGFR-driven progression is paramount to the exploration of (co)-treatment targets and predictive markers. METHODS: We performed function-based mapping of differentially expressed genes in EGFR-mediated local invasion (fDEGs) using photoconvertible tracers and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in a cellular 3D-model. RESULTS: Upon alignment with public single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets and HNSCC-specific regulons, a gene regulatory network of local invasion (invGRN) was inferred from gene expression data, which was overrepresented in budding tumors. InvGRN comprises the central hubs inhibin subunit beta alpha (INHBA) and snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2), and druggable fDEGs integrin subunit beta 4 (ITGB4), laminin 5 (LAMB3/LAMC2), and sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1). Blockade of INHBA repressed local invasion and was reverted by activin A, laminin 5, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, demonstrating a functional interconnectivity of the invGRN. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of malignant cells and the invGRN are induced by newly defined EGFR-activity subtypes with prognostic value that are promoted by amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG). Importantly, co-inhibition of SPHK1 showed synthetic effects on Cetuximab-mediated invasion blockade and high expression of selected fDEGs was associated with response to Cetuximab in patient-derived xenotransplantation (PDX) and R/M-HNSCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: We describe an actionable network of EGFR-mediated local invasion and define druggable effectors with predictive potential regarding the response of R/M-HNSCC to Cetuximab.

10.1038/s41467-025-58146-1	Solid-like condensation of MORF8 inhibits RNA editing under heat stress in Arabidopsis.	Wu J, Wang Y, Chen H, Xu T, Yang W, Fang X	Heat stress inhibits photosynthesis efficiency, thereby suppressing plant growth and crop yield. However, the mechanism underlying this inhibition is not fully understood. Here, we report that the multiple organellar RNA-editing factor 8 (MORF8) forms condensates with solid-like properties in chloroplasts upon heat stress. In vitro data show that the MORF8 condensation is intrinsically heat-dependent and primarily determined by its IDR (intrinsically disordered region). Purification and characterization of MORF8 condensates show that numerous editing factors including PPR proteins and MORFs are partitioned. We provide both genetic and biochemical evidence that MORF8 condensation inhibits chloroplast RNA editing. In agreement, we find that both heat stress and MORF8 condensation lead to reduced editing of RNAs encoding NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex and impaired NDH activity and photosynthesis efficiency. These findings uncover MORF8 as a putative chloroplastic thermosensor that mediates photosynthesis inhibition by heat and highlight the functional significance of solid material properties of biomolecular condensates.

Results from a phase 2 study of reldesemtiv in ALS suggested that it may slow disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of reldesemtiv vs placebo on functional outcomes in ALS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Reldesemtiv in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (COURAGE-ALS) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 randomized clinical trial conducted at 83 ALS centers in 16 countries from August 2021 to July 2023. The first 24-week period was placebo controlled vs reldesemtiv. All participants received reldesemtiv during the second 24-week period with a 4-week follow-up. Two interim analyses were planned, the first for futility and the second for futility and possible resizing. This was a hybrid decentralized trial with approximately half the trial visits performed remotely and the remaining visits in the clinic. Eligible participants met criteria for definite, probable, or possible ALS with lower motor neuron signs by modified El Escorial Criteria, ALS symptoms for 24 months or less, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) total score of 44 or less, and forced vital capacity of greater than or equal to 65% of predicted. INTERVENTIONS: Oral reldesemtiv, 300 mg, or placebo twice daily. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was change in ALSFRS-R total score from baseline to week 24. RESULTS: Of the 696 participants screened, 207 were screen failures. A total of 486 participants (mean [SD] age, 59.4 [10.9] years; 309 male [63.6%]) were randomized to reldesemtiv (n = 325) or placebo (n = 161); 3 randomized patients were not dosed. The second interim analysis at 24 weeks after randomization included 256 participants. The data monitoring committee recommended that the trial should end due to futility, and the sponsor agreed. The mean (SE) group difference in the ALSFRS-R score from baseline to week 24 was -1.1 (0.53; 95% CI, -2.17 to -0.08; P = .04, favoring placebo). Given excess missing data from early termination, the combined assessment assumed greater importance; it, too, failed to show a benefit from treatment with reldesemtiv (win probability was 0.44 for reldesemtiv and 0.49 for placebo, with a win ratio of 0.91; 95% CI of win ratio, 0.77-1.10; P = .11).

10.1099/ijsem.0.002654	Stackebrandtia soli sp.	Liu MJ, Jin CZ, Park DJ, Asem MD, Xiao M, Salam N, Li WJ, Kim CJ	An aerobic actinobacterium, strain AN130378(T), was isolated from a soil sample collected in Korea and subjected to taxonomic investigation using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data showed that strain AN130378(T) is a member of the genus Stackebrandtia, with sequence similarities of 97.3 % to Stackebrandtia albiflava YIM 45751(T) and 97.1 % to Stackebrandtia endophytica YIM 64602(T). The whole-cell hydrolysates contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid, and galactose, glucose and xylose. The major menaquinones were MK-11(H4), MK-10(H4) and MK-11(H6), while the major fatty acids were identified as iso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C17 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C17 : 0 and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω6c and/or C16 : 1ω7c). The polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, an unidentified aminophospholipid, four unidentified glycolipids, three unidentified phospholipids and two unidentified polar lipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 67.7 mol%. All chemotaxonomic and genotypic data indicated that the strain belongs to the genus Stackebrandtia.

10.1016/j.jad.2025.03.100	Association between RAR and the prevalence and prognosis of depression: A population-based study.	Zhu XF, Hu YQ, Long ZW, Cao MZ	BACKGROUND: Depression has become a significant public health issue. The red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR) is regarded as a reliable marker of inflammation and nutritional status, yet the association between them remains unknown. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the association between RAR and depression. METHODS: 28,737 participants were included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2018. The weighted multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression explored the relationship between RAR and the prevalence and mortality of depression. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) detected nonlinear relationships and threshold effects. The stratified analysis explored potential interaction variables. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, 2519 participants (7.67 %) had depression. Weighted multivariate logistic regression showed RAR was independently associated depression (OR = 1.26, 95 % CI = 1.12, 1.42, P < 0.001). In the cohort study, there were 301 cases of all-cause mortality (9.94 %) in depression population, including 77 cases of cardiovascular mortality (2.66 %). Weighted multivariate Cox regression analysis presented that RAR was related to higher all-cause mortality (HR = 1.98, 95 % CI = 1.62, 2.42, P < 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (HR = 1.73, 95 % CI = 1.19, 2.51, P = 0.004) in the depression population. Subgroup analysis showed that RAR was consistently related to the prevalence and mortality of depression across all subgroups (all P < 0.05). RCS revealed that the relationship between RAR and depression was nonlinear (P for nonlinear = 0.011), while the association between RAR and all-cause mortality was linear (P for nonlinear = 0.245). CONCLUSIONS: RAR is significantly associated with the prevalence and prognosis of depression. Nevertheless, more investigation is required to elucidate the underlying processes.

Lucantonio F, Roeglin J, Li S, Lu J, Shi A, Czerpaniak K, Fiocchi FR, Bontempi L, Shields BC, Zarate CA Jr, Tadross MR, Pignatelli M	Ketamine is recognized as a rapid and sustained antidepressant, particularly for major depression unresponsive to conventional treatments. Anhedonia is a common symptom of depression for which ketamine is highly efficacious, but the underlying circuits and synaptic changes are not well understood. Here, we show that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is essential for ketamine's effect in rescuing anhedonia in mice subjected to chronic stress. Specifically, a single exposure to ketamine rescues stress-induced decreased strength of excitatory synapses on NAc-D1 dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs). Using a cell-specific pharmacology method, we establish the necessity of this synaptic restoration for the sustained therapeutic effects of ketamine on anhedonia. Examining causal sufficiency, artificially increasing excitatory synaptic strength onto D1-MSNs recapitulates the behavioral amelioration induced by ketamine. Finally, we used opto- and chemogenetic approaches to determine the presynaptic origin of the relevant synapses, implicating monosynaptic inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus.

Iwawaki T, Yanagisawa S, Inden Y, Hiramatsu K, Yamauchi R, Miyamae K, Miyazawa H, Goto T, Kondo S, Tachi M, Shimojo M, Tsuji Y, Murohara T	IMPORTANCE: There is no clear consensus regarding the discontinuation of oral anticoagulants (OACs) after catheter ablation (CA) for atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate thromboembolic and major bleeding events and all-cause death following OAC discontinuation and characteristics associated with patient prognoses after successful CA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included patients without AF recurrence or adverse events 12 months after CA among those undergoing their first CA between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2021. The study population was divided into groups according to the continuation and discontinuation of OACs at the landmark period of 12 months after CA. Follow-up data were acquired until December 31, 2023, and the study analysis was conducted from January to April 2024. EXPOSURES: OAC discontinuation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were thromboembolic and major bleeding events and all-cause death after 12 months. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and propensity score-matched analyses were used to adjust baseline characteristics. RESULTS: This study included 1821 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.6 [11.7] years; 1339 men [73.5%]). Overall, 922 patients (50.6%) continued OAC for 12 months, whereas 899 (49.4%) discontinued OAC. During a mean (SD) follow-up of 4.8 (4.0) years, thromboembolic events, major bleeding events, and death occurred in 43 (2.4%), 41 (2.3%), and 71 (3.9%) patients, respectively. After IPTW adjustment, the OAC discontinuation group demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of thromboembolism (incidence rate, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.45-1.35] vs 0.37 [95% CI, 0.22-0.54] per 100 person-years; log-rank P = .04) and a lower incidence of major bleeding (incidence rate, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.02-0.19] vs 0.65 [95% CI, 0.43-0.90] per 100 person-years; log-rank P < .001) than in the continuation group. In a subgroup analysis, OAC discontinuation was associated with a higher risk of thromboembolism in patients with asymptomatic AF, left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 60%, and left atrial diameter of 45 mm or greater. In contrast, OAC discontinuation was beneficial for reducing major bleeding risks in patients with a HAS-BLED score of 2 or greater. These outcomes were similar in the propensity score-matched analysis using 1100 paired matched patients, except for insignificant differences in thromboembolic events. Differences in mortality between the 2 groups were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this retrospective cohort study, discontinuation of OACs after successful CA was associated with increased thromboembolic events and decreased bleeding events. The benefits of discontinuing OACs were stratified according to specific characteristics, pending a future prospective randomized study.

10.1002/cam4.70813	Uncovering the Effects and Molecular Mechanisms of Shaoyao Decoction Against Colorectal Cancer Using Network Pharmacology Analysis Coupled With Experimental Validation and Gut Microbiota Analysis.	Rong Y, Zhang G, Ye W, Qi L, Hao X, Li X, Zhang W, Chao Y, Gu S	BACKGROUND: Chronic gut inflammation and dysbiosis contribute significantly to colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Shaoyao decoction (SYD) is a well-established Chinese medicine prescription. Besides ameliorating CRC via anti-inflammatory effects, SYD modulates gut microbiota (GM) to improve inflammatory responses in ulcerative colitis (UC). However, whether and how SYD suppresses CRC by regulating GM remains largely unknown. METHODS: SD rats were orally administered SYD for 7 days to obtain medicated serum. We utilized liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, GeneCards, DisGeNET, and SwissTargetPrediction databases to analyze blank and SYD-medicated rat serum, comparing the findings with those of SYD aqueous extract in previous studies to identify SYD circulating compounds/components with predictable target genes. Using network pharmacology, the potential active compounds and corresponding hub genes associated with modulating GM to suppress CRC were selected for molecular docking. In vivo experiments, a CRC transplantation tumor model was established in BALB/c mice using CT26 cells, with SYD gavage for 14 days. To investigate the mechanism of SYD-regulated GM against CRC, HE and IHC staining, Western blotting, and 16S rRNA sequencing were employed. RESULTS: LC-MS identified 26 SYD compounds with computationally predicted target genes. Network pharmacology prioritized 13 compounds targeting 8 inflammation/immunity-related genes (IL-17/TNF pathways), validated by molecular docking. In vivo experiments, SYD dose-dependently suppressed tumor growth (p < 0.05, medium/high doses), as confirmed by HE staining and IHC analysis of Ki-67. Notably, SYD potentially delayed CRC liver metastasis and alleviated hepatic injury in tumor-bearing mice. Western blotting demonstrated SYD's inhibition of the IL-17/TNF/NF-κB axis, aligning with computational predictions. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed SYD-enriched Akkermansia and GM structural shifts, mechanistically linking microbiota remodeling to anti-tumor efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: SYD combats CRC via dual modulation of IL-17/TNF/NF-κB signaling and GM ecosystems (e.g., Akkermansia enrichment). This microbiota-immune crosstalk positions SYD as a potential adjunct to conventional therapies, particularly for CRC patients with dysbiosis.

METHODS: In this 13-week, multicenter trial, adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive AID or to continue their pretrial insulin-delivery method (control group); both groups received continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). The primary outcome was the glycated hemoglobin level at 13 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 319 patients underwent randomization. Glycated hemoglobin levels decreased by 0.9 percentage points (from 8.2±1.4% at baseline to 7.3±0.9% at week 13) in the AID group and by 0.3 percentage points (from 8.1±1.2% to 7.7±1.1%) in the control group (mean adjusted difference, -0.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.8 to -0.4; P<0.001). The mean percentage of time that patients were in the target glucose range of 70 to 180 mg per deciliter increased from 48±24% to 64±16% in the AID group and from 51±21% to 52±21% in the control group (mean difference, 14 percentage points; 95% CI, 11 to 17; P<0.001). All other multiplicity-controlled CGM outcomes reflective of hyperglycemia that were measured were significantly better in the AID group than in the control group. The frequency of CGM-measured hypoglycemia was low in both groups. A severe hypoglycemia event occurred in one patient in the AID group. CONCLUSIONS: In this 13-week, randomized, controlled trial involving adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, AID was associated with a greater reduction in glycated hemoglobin levels than CGM alone.

Cortés-Hernández LE, Eslami-S Z, Attina A, Batista S, Cayrefourcq L, Vialeret J, Di Vizio D, Hirtz C, Costa-Silva B, Alix-Panabières C	BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are pivotal in cancer progression, and in vitro CTC models are crucial for understanding their biological mechanisms. This study focused on the characterization of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from CTC lines derived from a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) at different stages of progression who progressed despite therapy (thus mirroring the clonal evolution of cancer). METHODS AND RESULTS: Morphological and size analyses revealed variations among EVs derived from different CTC lines. Compared with the Vesiclepedia database, proteomic profiling of these EVs revealed enrichment of proteins related to stemness, endosomal biogenesis, and mCRC prognosis. Integrin family proteins were significantly enriched in EVs from CTC lines derived after therapy failure. The role of these EVs in cancer progression was analyzed by assessing their in vivo distribution, particularly in the liver, lungs, kidneys, and bones. EVs accumulate significantly in the liver, followed by the lungs, kidneys and femurs. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a pioneering effort in highlighting therapy progression-associated changes in EVs from mCRC patients via an in vitro CTC model. The results offer insights into the role of metastasis initiator CTC-derived EVs in cancer spread, suggesting their utility for studying cancer tissue distribution mechanisms. However, these findings must be confirmed and extended to patients with mCRC. This work underscores the potential of CTC-derived EVs as tools for understanding cancer dissemination.

10.1016/j.jaci.2025.03.007	MRGPRX2 Gain-of-Function Mutation Drives Enhanced Mast Cell Reactivity in Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria.	Ye D, Zhang Y, Zhao X, Zhou H, Guo J, Yang M, Niu X, Wang X, Yuan J, Ren J, Geng S, Zeng W, Wang Z	BACKGROUND: Mast cell activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Mutations in mast cell receptors have been suggested as a potential mechanism underlying CSU. MRGPRX2 has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of CSU. However, the relationship between mutations in MRGPRX2 and their impact on disease severity and receptor function remains poorly understood. METHODS: 80 CSU patients were included in the study. Peripheral blood was collected for DNA sequencing in the coding exon of MRGPRX2. UAS7 scores and laboratory tests were recorded, serum MRGPRX2 levels were measured by ELISA. RBL-2H3 cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) MRGPRX2 and mutant variants. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess MRGPRX2 cell surface expression. Functional assays were performed to measure degranulation by β-hexosaminidase release, calcium mobilization, and cytokine synthesis by RT-qPCR. Additionally, phosphorylation of signaling kinases was detected by western blotting. RESULTS: Missense variants of MRGPRX2 185A>G (n=8, 10%) and 185A>G+46A>C co-mutations (n=23, 28.75%) were identified in CSU patients. Patients carrying 185A>G mutation had significantly higher UAS7 scores, lower circulating basophil and lymphocyte counts than those with WT MRGPRX2. The 185A>G mutation but not 185A>G+46A>C was associated with increased MRGPRX2 expression in both CSU patients and RBL-2H3 cells expressing the 185A>G mutation. Cells transfected with the 185A>G mutation demonstrated increased mast cell degranulation, calcium mobilization, cytokine synthesis, and ERK phosphorylation upon MRGPRX2 activation, whereas the 46A>C+185A>G co-mutation did not show these changes. CONCLUSIONS: The 185A>G mutation in MRGPRX2 contributes to a gain-of-function phenotype that is associated with enhanced disease activity in CSU patients.

Additionally, we examine the potential relationship between specific genetic subgroups and treatment response. METHODS: This study was conducted across 27 epilepsy centers and included patients with monogenic epileptic disorders (pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants) who were treated with highly purified CBD for at least 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 266 patients (135 females, 50.8%) with monogenic epilepsies were included with a median age at CBD initiation of 12 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 7-19) and a median follow-up duration of 17 months (IQR = 12-24). Overall, 77 different monogenic epilepsies have been included, with the most common genes being SCN1A (32.3%), TSC2 (13.5%), CDKL5, and MECP2 (4.5% each). The mean seizure reduction at the last follow-up was 38.6%, with 47.5% of patients achieving ≥50% seizure reduction and 7.4% achieving seizure freedom. The Clinical Global Impression scale indicated improvement in 65.8% of patients. The general linear mixed model revealed that a shorter maximum duration of seizure freedom before CBD initiation and a higher degree of intellectual disability were independently associated with lower CBD effectiveness. Conversely, no significant differences in seizure outcome were observed across different epilepsy syndromes (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex epilepsy, and other developmental and epileptic encephalopathy), between approved indications and off-label use, or between concomitant clobazam use or not. SIGNIFICANCE: This study supports CBD as a potential treatment for monogenic epilepsies beyond its licensed indications, demonstrating comparable effectiveness between approved and off-label use and suggesting genetic subgroups with promising treatment responses.

10.1186/s12879-025-10747-3	Standard versus double dosing of beta-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients with sepsis: The BULLSEYE study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial.	Horstink MMB, Geel DR, Uil CAD, Deetman PE, Endeman H, Abdulla A, Bosch TM, Rietdijk WJR, Thielen FW, Haringman JJ, van Vliet P, Rijpstra TA, Bethlehem C, Beishuizen A, Muller AE, Koch BCP	BACKGROUND: Sepsis and septic shock are significant global healthcare challenges with high mortality rates. Effective management requires timely and adequate antimicrobial therapy. Beta-lactam antibiotics, commonly used in patients with sepsis, are crucial for treating these infections. However, standard dosing often leads to insufficient plasma levels due to dynamic physiological changes in critically ill patients. Previous randomized controlled trials highlighted the need for timely dose adjustments to improve clinical outcomes. This is the study protocol for the BULLSEYE trial in which we aim to optimize antibiotic treatment during the initial 48 h of sepsis by comparing standard to double dosing of beta-lactam antibiotics. METHODS: This open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial will compare standard to double dosing of beta-lactam antibiotics (cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, flucloxacillin, meropenem, and piperacillin/clavulanic acid) in critically ill patients with septic shock. Participants will be randomized into two arms: the control arm receiving standard care, and the intervention arm receiving double antibiotic doses for 48 h, irrespective of renal function. Following this period, all patients will receive standard doses as per local protocol. The primary outcome is all cause 28-day mortality, with secondary outcomes including 90-day, 365-day, hospital and ICU mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay, SOFA scores, time to shock reversal, microbiological eradication, clinical cure, pharmacodynamic target attainment, safety, quality of life, and medical consumption. DISCUSSION: The BULLSEYE trial aims to improve sepsis treatment in critically ill patients. Despite anticipated recruitment challenges, its large sample size ensures robust comparability. This pivotal trial could significantly impact sepsis treatment, leading to better clinical outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EU_CT 2024-512950-13-00. Protocol version 2.3, protocol date 09-12-2024.

Kisseleva T, Ganguly S, Murad R, Wang A, Brenner DA	Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a condition characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the hepatocytes, unrelated to alcohol consumption. In a healthy liver, HSCs are quiescent, store vitamin A, and function as pericytes. However, in response to liver injury and inflammation, HSCs become activated. In MASH, HSC activation is driven by metabolic stress, lipotoxicity, and chronic inflammation. Injured hepatocytes, recruited macrophage, capillarized sinusoidal endothelial cells, and permeable intestinal epithelium may each contribute to activating HSCS. This leads to a unique inflammatory environment that promotes fibrosis. MASH HSCs change their metabolism to favor glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and lactate generation. Activated HSCs transform into myofibroblast-like cells, producing excessive extracellular matrix components that result in fibrosis. In addition, HSCs in MASH have inflammatory and intermediate activated phenotypes. This fibrotic process is a key feature of MASH, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Understanding the mechanisms of HSC activation and their role in MASH progression is essential for developing targeted therapies to treat and prevent liver fibrosis in affected individuals.

Zou Q, Chen Y, Liu D, Du Q, Zhang C, Mai Q, Wang X, Lin X, Chen Q, Wei M, Chi C, Yao S, Liu J	Cuproptosis is a novel form of regulated cell death triggered by copper ion and copper ionophore. While cuproptosis has been actively explored as a potential target for cancer therapy, its role in ovarian cancer (OC) still remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that cuproptosis inhibits OC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through FDX1 regulation and suppresses tumor growth in a mouse model. We also confirm that cuproptosis enhances OC sensitivity to cisplatin treatment both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, our findings reveal that cuproptosis affects cholesterol biosynthesis in OC cells, with cholesterol playing a crucial role in its cytotoxic effect.

10.1038/s42003-025-07921-3	Roles of TLR4 in macrophage immunity and macrophage-pulmonary vascular/lymphatic endothelial cell interactions in sepsis.	Fu Y, Gong T, Loughran PA, Li Y, Billiar TR, Liu Y, Wen Z, Fan J	In sepsis, acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe complication and a leading cause of death, involving complex mechanisms that include cellular and molecular interactions between immune and lung parenchymal cells. In recent decades, the role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in mediating infection-induced inflammation has been extensively studied. However, how TLR4 facilitates interactions between innate immune cells and lung parenchymal cells in sepsis remains to be fully understood. This study aims to explore the role of TLR4 in regulating macrophage immunity and metabolism in greater depth. It also seeks to reveal how changes in these processes affect the interaction between macrophages and both pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Using TLR4 knockout mice and the combined approaches of single-cell RNA sequencing and experimental validation, we demonstrate that in sepsis, TLR4-deficient macrophages upregulate Abca1, enhance cholesterol efflux, and reduce glycolysis, promoting M2 polarization and attenuating inflammation. These metabolic and phenotypic shifts significantly affect their interactions with pulmonary ECs and LECs. Mechanistically, we uncovered that TLR4 operates through multiple pathways in endothelial dysfunction: macrophage TLR4 mediates inflammatory damage to ECs/LECs, while endothelial TLR4 both directly sensitizes cells to lipopolysaccharide-induced injury and determines their susceptibility to macrophage-derived inflammatory signals. These findings reveal the complex role of TLR4 in orchestrating both immune-mediated and direct endothelial responses during sepsis-induced ALI, supporting that targeting TLR4 on multiple cell populations may present an effective therapeutic strategy.

These findings reveal the complex role of TLR4 in orchestrating both immune-mediated and direct endothelial responses during sepsis-induced ALI, supporting that targeting TLR4 on multiple cell populations may present an effective therapeutic strategy.	role TLR4 macrophage immunity macrophage pulmonary vascular lymphatic endothelial cell interaction sepsis sepsis acute lung injury ali be severe complication lead cause death involve complex mechanism include cellular molecular interaction immune lung parenchymal cell recent decade role toll like receptor 4 TLR4 mediate infection induce inflammation have be extensively study however TLR4 facilitate interaction innate immune cell lung parenchymal cell sepsis remain to be fully understand study aim to explore role TLR4 regulate macrophage immunity metabolism great depth also seek to reveal change process affect interaction macrophage pulmonary endothelial cell ecs lymphatic endothelial cell lecs use TLR4 knockout mouse combine approach single cell rna sequence experimental validation demonstrate sepsis TLR4 deficient macrophage upregulate abca1 enhance cholesterol efflux reduce glycolysis promote m2 polarization attenuate inflammation metabolic phenotypic shift significantly affect interaction pulmonary ec lec mechanistically uncover TLR4 operate multiple pathway endothelial dysfunction macrophage TLR4 mediate inflammatory damage ecs lec endothelial TLR4 directly sensitize cell lipopolysaccharide induce injury determine susceptibility macrophage derive inflammatory signal finding reveal complex role TLR4 orchestrate immune mediate direct endothelial response sepsis induce ali support target TLR4 multiple cell population may present effective therapeutic strategy

Recent work has raised the intriguing prospect that phase transitions in proteins and lipids can be co-regulated. Here we investigate this possibility in the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granule-ANXA11-lysosome ensemble, where ANXA11 tethers RNP granules to lysosomal membranes to enable their co-trafficking. We show that changes to the protein phase state within this system, driven by the low complexity ANXA11 N-terminus, induces a coupled phase state change in the lipids of the underlying membrane. We identify the ANXA11 interacting proteins ALG2 and CALC as potent regulators of ANXA11-based phase coupling and demonstrate their influence on the nanomechanical properties of the ANXA11-lysosome ensemble and its capacity to engage RNP granules. The phenomenon of protein-lipid phase coupling we observe within this system serves as a potential regulatory mechanism in RNA trafficking and offers an important template to understand other examples across the cell whereby biomolecular condensates closely juxtapose organellar membranes.

However, it remains unknown whether targeting CCR2, the cognate receptor of CCL2, provides protection against human atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Computationally predicted damaging or loss-of-function (REVEL > 0.5) variants within CCR2 were detected in whole-exome-sequencing data from 454,775 UK Biobank participants and tested for association with cardiovascular endpoints in gene-burden tests. Given the key role of CCR2 in monocyte mobilization, variants associated with lower monocyte count were prioritized for experimental validation. The response to CCL2 of human cells transfected with these variants was tested in migration and cAMP assays. Validated damaging variants were tested for association with cardiovascular endpoints, atherosclerosis burden, and vascular risk factors. Significant associations were replicated in six independent datasets (n = 1,062,595). RESULTS: Carriers of 45 predicted damaging or loss-of-function CCR2 variants (n = 787 individuals) were at lower risk of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. One of these variants (M249K, n = 585, 0.15% of European ancestry individuals) was associated with lower monocyte count and with both decreased downstream signaling and chemoattraction in response to CCL2. While M249K showed no association with conventional vascular risk factors, it was consistently associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR]: 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.81, p = 6.1 × 10(-5)) and coronary artery disease (OR: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.63-0.87, p = 2.9 × 10(-4)) in the UK Biobank and in six replication cohorts. In a phenome-wide association study, there was no evidence of a higher risk of infections among M249K carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of an experimentally confirmed damaging CCR2 variant are at a lower lifetime risk of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease without carrying a higher risk of infections. Our findings provide genetic support for the translational potential of CCR2-targeting as an atheroprotective approach.

Huang Y, Wei Z, Wang L, Zhang G, Yang G, Yu J, Wu Q, Liu J	OBJECTIVE: This study sought to clarify the relationship between triglyceride-glucose (TyG)-related obesity indices and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with hyperuricemia (HUA). METHOD: A total of 4207 patients with HUA from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database were included in this study. Various methods were employed, including weighted multivariate-adjusted Cox regression models, Kaplan-Meier curves, restricted cubic spline, and receiver operating curves. RESULTS: A nonlinear relationship was identified between TyG-related obesity indices and all-cause mortality, while a linear positive relationship was observed for cardiovascular mortality. Among the indices, TyG-ABSI (a body shape index) demonstrated the strongest predictive ability, with areas under the curve for all-cause mortality at 3, 5, and 10 years being 0.638, 0.632, and 0.650, respectively, and for cardiovascular mortality at 3, 5, and 10 years being 0.699, 0.673, and 0.671, respectively. Threshold analysis revealed the potential inflection point (k) of the nonlinear relationship. Subgroup analyses indicated interactions with age, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. Additionally, serum uric acid was found to partially mediate the association between TyG-derived indices and follow-up time. The results of the sensitivity analysis were consistent with those of the original analysis. CONCLUSIONS: TyG-ABSI, which exhibited the best predictive ability, may serve as a valuable biomarker for the long-term follow-up of individuals with HUA.

10.1016/j.ymthe.2025.03.030	Recent developments in gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.	Szunyogh S, Carroll E, Wade-Martins R	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder for which there is currently no cure. Gene therapy has emerged as a novel approach offering renewed hope for the development of treatments that meaningfully alter the course of the disease. In this review we explore various gene therapy strategies currently being developed targeting key aspects of PD pathogenesis: the restoration of the dopamine system by delivering genes involved in dopamine biosynthesis; reinforcing the inhibitory signalling pathways through glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) delivery to increase GABA production; enhancing neuronal survival and development by introducing various neurotrophic factors; delivery of genes to complement recessive familial PD mutations to correct mitochondrial dysfunction; restoring lysosomal function through delivery of GBA1 to increase glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity; and reducing alpha-synuclein levels by reducing or silencing SNCA expression. Despite promising early work, challenges remain in developing safe, effective, and long-lasting gene therapies. Key considerations include optimizing viral vectors for targeted delivery, achieving controlled and sustained gene expression using different promoters, minimizing immune responses and increasing transgene delivery capacity. Future prospects may involve combinatory strategies targeting multiple pathways, such as multi-gene constructs delivered via high-capacity viral systems.

10.1186/s12937-025-01110-y	The mediating roles of anthropo-metabolic biomarkers on the association between beverage consumption and breast cancer risk.	Lin X, Liang B, Lam TH, Cheng KK, Zhang W, Xu L	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy in women, yet the role of beverage consumption in BC risk remains unclear. Additionally, the contribution of anthropo-metabolic biomarkers as mediators is unknown, limiting the development of effective prevention strategies. METHODS: This study included 13,567 participants from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS), where beverage consumption was assessed at baseline using a food frequency questionnaire. BC cases were identified through cancer registry linkage over a mean follow-up of 14.8 years. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to evaluate the causal effects of beverage consumption on BC risk, with a two-step MR approach used to estimate mediation effects. RESULTS: During follow-up, 243 BC cases were identified. Weekly consumption of ≥ 1 portion of sugar sweetened beverages (SSB), versus < 1 portion, was significantly associated with a higher risk of BC (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.23). This association was partly mediated by body mass index (proportion mediated [PM] 4.2%, 95% CI 0.9-17.1%) and uric acid (PM 18.8%, 95% CI 1.5-77.5%). Weekly consumption of > 6 portions of dairy-based milk was associated with a non-significantly higher BC risk (HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.99-2.03), while 3-6 portions of soy milk were associated with a lower BC risk (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.10-0.98). No significant associations were found for pure fruit juice, coffee, tea, or alcoholic drinks. MR analyses supported the detrimental effect of SSB on BC risk, with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids to total fatty acids (TFAs) ratio, and omega-6 fatty acids to TFAs ratio mediating 2.44%, 2.73%, and 3.53% of the association, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that SSB consumption was a risk factor for BC and identified key anthropo-metabolic biomarkers mediating this relationship. Reducing SSB consumption and addressing associated metabolic pathways may offer effective strategies for BC prevention.

Li S, Jiang G, Wang S, Wang M, Wu Y, Zhang J, Liu X, Zhong L, Zhou M, Xie S, Ren Y, He P, Lou Y, Li H, Du J, Zhou Z	The proliferation of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria is driven by the global spread of epidemic lineages that accumulate antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). Acinetobacter baumannii, a leading cause of nosocomial infections, displays resistance to most frontline antimicrobials and represents a significant challenge to public health. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive genomic analysis of over 15,000 A. baumannii genomes to identify a predominant epidemic super-lineage (ESL) accounting for approximately 70% of global isolates. Through hierarchical classification of the ESL into distinct lineages, clusters, and clades, we identified a stepwise evolutionary trajectory responsible for the worldwide expansion and transmission of A. baumannii over the last eight decades. We observed the rise and global spread of a previously unrecognized Clade 2.5.6, which emerged in East Asia in 2006. The epidemic of the clade is linked to the ongoing acquisition of ARGs and virulence factors facilitated by genetic recombination. Our results highlight the necessity for One Health-oriented research and interventions to address the spread of this MDR pathogen.

The Japanese Critical Care Nutrition Guideline 2024 (JCCNG 2024) is specific to Japan and is the latest set of clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy in critical care that was revised from JCCNG 2016 by the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine. An English version of these guidelines was created based on the contents of the original Japanese version. These guidelines were developed to help health care providers understand and provide nutrition therapy that will improve the outcomes of children and adults admitted to intensive care units or requiring intensive care, regardless of the disease. The intended users of these guidelines are all healthcare professionals involved in intensive care, including those who are not familiar with nutrition therapy. JCCNG 2024 consists of 37 clinical questions and 24 recommendations, covering immunomodulation therapy, nutrition therapy for special conditions, and nutrition therapy for children. These guidelines were developed in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system by experts from various healthcare professionals related to nutrition therapy and/or critical care. All GRADE-based recommendations, good practice statements (GPS), future research questions, and answers to background questions were finalized by consensus using the modified Delphi method. Strong recommendations for adults include early enteral nutrition (EN) within 48 h and the provision of pre/synbiotics. Weak recommendations for adults include the use of a nutrition protocol, EN rather than parenteral nutrition, the provision of higher protein doses, post-pyloric EN, continuous EN, omega-3 fatty acid-enriched EN, the provision of probiotics, and indirect calorimetry use. Weak recommendations for children include early EN within 48 h, bolus EN, and energy/protein-dense EN formulas. A nutritional assessment is recommended by GPS for both adults and children. JCCNG 2024 will be disseminated through educational activities mainly by the JCCNG Committee at various scientific meetings and seminars. Since studies on nutritional treatment for critically ill patients are being reported worldwide, these guidelines will be revised in 4 to 6 years. We hope that these guidelines will be used in clinical practice for critically ill patients and in future research.

Weak recommendations for adults include the use of a nutrition protocol, EN rather than parenteral nutrition, the provision of higher protein doses, post-pyloric EN, continuous EN, omega-3 fatty acid-enriched EN, the provision of probiotics, and indirect calorimetry use. Weak recommendations for children include early EN within 48 h, bolus EN, and energy/protein-dense EN formulas. A nutritional assessment is recommended by GPS for both adults and children. JCCNG 2024 will be disseminated through educational activities mainly by the JCCNG Committee at various scientific meetings and seminars. Since studies on nutritional treatment for critically ill patients are being reported worldwide, these guidelines will be revised in 4 to 6 years. We hope that these guidelines will be used in clinical practice for critically ill patients and in future research.	japanese critical care nutrition guideline 2024 nutrition therapy be important management critically ill patient be continuously evolve new evidence emerge japanese critical care nutrition guideline 2024 jccng 2024 be specific japan be late set clinical practice guideline nutrition therapy critical care be revise jccng 2016 japanese society intensive care medicine english version guideline be create base content original japanese version guideline be develop to help health care provider understand provide nutrition therapy will improve outcome child adult admit intensive care unit require intensive care regardless disease intended user guideline be healthcare professional involve intensive care include be not familiar nutrition therapy jccng 2024 consist 37 clinical question 24 recommendation cover immunomodulation therapy nutrition therapy special condition nutrition therapy child guideline be develop accordance grading recommendations assessment development evaluation grade system expert various healthcare professional relate nutrition therapy and/or critical care grade base recommendation good practice statement gps future research question answer background question be finalize consensus use modify delphi method strong recommendation adult include early enteral nutrition en 48 h provision pre synbiotic weak recommendation adult include use nutrition protocol en rather parenteral nutrition provision high protein dose post pyloric en continuous en omega-3 fatty acid enrich en provision probiotic indirect calorimetry use weak recommendation child include early en 48 h bolus en energy protein dense en formula nutritional assessment be recommend gps adult child jccng 2024 will be disseminate educational activity mainly jccng committee various scientific meeting seminar study nutritional treatment critically ill patient be be report worldwide guideline will be revise 4 to 6 year hope guideline will be use clinical practice critically ill patient future research
10.1080/15548627.2025.2477443	HMBOX1 reverses autophagy mediated 5-fluorouracil resistance through promoting HACE1-induced ubiquitination and degradation of ATG5 in colorectal cancer.	Gao Y, Fu S, Peng Y, Zhou Y, Zhu J, Zhang X, Cai C, Han Y, Shen H, Zeng S	Chemotherapy remains the primary treatment for unresectable or advanced postoperative colorectal cancers. However, its effectiveness is compromised by chemoresistance, which adversely affects patient outcomes. Dysregulated macroautophagy/autophagy is a proposed mechanism behind this resistance, with ubiquitination playing a key regulatory role. In this study, we identify the transcription factor HMBOX1 (homeobox containing 1) as a critical regulator of chemoresistance in colorectal cancer. RNA sequencing revealed that HMBOX1 is downregulated in drug-resistant colorectal cancer cells and tissues, with its low expression linked to poor prognosis. An integrated analysis of genes associated with autophagy and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance was conducted, verified in the colorectal cancer tissues of patients by single-cell RNA sequencing and immunostaining. Mass-spectrometry-based proteomics and RNA sequencing were used to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Functionally, upregulation of HMBOX1 enhances the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to the first-line treatment with 5-FU by inhibiting autophagy. Mechanistically, HMBOX1 promotes the transcription of the E3 ubiquitin ligase HACE1, which in turn enhances ATG5 K63-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. This results in decreased ATG5 levels, inhibiting autophagy and thus reducing 5-FU resistance in colorectal cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we confirm that HMBOX1 expression positively correlates with HACE1 expression and inversely correlates with autophagy levels in clinical colorectal cancer tissues. Our findings suggest that HMBOX1 downregulation drives 5-FU resistance through autophagy enhancement in colorectal cancer, highlighting HMBOX1 as a potential target for improving chemosensitivity and patient prognosis.Abbreviation: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; 5-FU: 5-fluorouracil; ATG: autophagy related; CASP3: caspase 3; C-CASP3: cleaved caspase 3; C-PARP: cleaved PARP; CCK8: cell counting kit-8; ChIP: chromatin immunoprecipitation; CHX: cycloheximide; CNV: copy number variation; co-IP: co-immunoprecipitation; COAD: colorectal adenocarcinoma; CQ: chloroquine; CRC: colorectal cancer; CR: complete response; FHC: fetal human colon; GEO: Gene Expression Omnibus; HACE1: HECT domain and ankyrin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1; HMBOX1: homeobox containing 1; IHC: immunohistochemistry; LC-MS/MS: liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; mIHC: multiplexed immunohistochemistry; MUT: mutant; NC: negative control; OS: overall survival; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PD: progressive disease; PFA: paraformaldehyde; PFS: progression-free survival; PR: partial response; qPCR: quantitative polymerase chain reaction; RAPA: rapamycin; SD: stable disease; TCGA: The Cancer Genome Atlas; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TF: translation factor; USP22: ubiquitin specific peptidase 22; WT: wild type.

Yu Y, Gao X, Zhao H, Sun J, Wang M, Xiong X, Li J, Huang C, Zhang H, Jiang G, Xiao X	Mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family members are frequently observed in metastatic bladder cancer. The development of erdafitinib, a pan-FGFR inhibitor, provided a significant therapeutic advance in bladder cancer, but resistance still limits its efficacy. In this study, we performed an unbiased whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 synthetic lethal screen on FGFR-mutant bladder cancer cell lines treated with erdafitinib and identified spermidine synthase (SRM) as a critical contributor to erdafitinib resistance. Moreover, hypusinated eIF5A, catalyzed by SRM-mediated spermidine production, facilitated the efficient translation of HMGA2, which in turn promoted the expression of EGFR. Notably, pharmacologic inhibition of SRM enhanced the efficacy of erdafitinib both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results offer evidence that targeting SRM could attenuate the translation of HMGA2 and subsequently reduce EGFR transcription, thus enhancing the sensitivity of FGFR-mutant bladder cancer cells to erdafitinib treatment.

Kim J, Kim D, Kim D, Park BE, Kang TS, Lim SH, Lee SY, Chung YH, Lee MY, Yang PS, Joung B	BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of the polygenic risk score in predicting cardiovascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has not yet been established. This study aimed to determine whether the polygenic risk score for AF might be useful in the risk stratification of AF-related cardiovascular events. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 9597 oral anticoagulation-naive patients with AF with a CHA(2)DS(2)-VA (congestive heart failure; hypertension; age ≥75 years; diabetes; prior stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism; vascular disease; and age 65-74 years) score of 0 or 1 from the UK Biobank. Patients were stratified according to polygenic risk score tertiles and observed for the occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, and heart failure hospitalization. The risks of incident events associated with the polygenic risk score were investigated using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Of 9597 individuals, 3800 (39.6%) were women and the mean±SD age was 65.3±6.4 years. During a median follow-up of 4.6 years (interquartile range, 1.7-7.9 years), the incidence rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, and heart failure hospitalization were 0.83, 0.42, and 0.61 per 100 person-years, respectively. Compared with low genetic risk, high genetic risk was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.38 (95% CI, 1.08-1.76; P=0.011) for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, 1.15 (95% CI, 0.82-1.61; P=0.422) for myocardial infarction, and 1.02 (95% CI, 0.78-1.34; P=0.895) for heart failure hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AF with low-intermediate stroke risk, genetic risk for AF is associated with increased risk of stroke or systemic embolism.

However, its progression from asymptomatic stages to an aggressive disease that ultimately fails to respond to treatments is also dependent on changes of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a prevalent clonal condition of the hematopoietic stem cell whose presence is causally linked to a more inflamed microenvironment. Here, we show in 106 patients with MM that CHIP is frequently co-existing with MM at diagnosis, associates with a more advanced R-ISS stage, higher age and shows a non-significant trend towards lower median hemoglobin. In our cohort the two conditions do not share a clonal origin. Single cell RNA-sequencing in 16 MM patients highlights significant TME changes when CHIP is present: decreased naïve T cells, a pro-inflammatory TME, decreased antigen-presenting function by dendritic cells and expression of exhaustion markers in CD8 cells. Inferred interactions between cell types in CHIP-positive TME suggested that especially monocytes, T cells and clonal plasma cells may have a prominent role in mediating inflammation, immune evasion and pro-survival signals in favor of MM cells. Altogether, our data show that, in the presence of CHIP, the TME of MM at diagnosis is significantly disrupted in line with what usually seen in more advanced disease, with potential translational implications. Our data highlight the relevance of this association and prompt for further studies on the modifier role of CHIP in the MM TME.

10.1089/rej.2012.1389	Protective effects of ginger root extract on Alzheimer disease-induced behavioral dysfunction in rats.	Zeng GF, Zhang ZY, Lu L, Xiao DQ, Zong SH, He JM	The aim of this study was to assess the ability of a traditional Chinese medicinal ginger root extract (GRE) to prevent behavioral dysfunction in the Alzheimer disease (AD) rat model. Rat AD models were established by an operation (OP) in which rats were treated with a one-time intra-cerebroventricuIar injection of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and continuous gavage of aluminum chloride every day for 4 weeks. GRE was administered intra-gastrically to rats. After 35 days, learning and memory were assessed in all of the rats. Brain sections were processed for immunohistochemistry and Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) and Nissl staining. The latency to show significant memory deficits was shorter in the group that received OP with a high dose of GRE (HG)(OP+HG) than in the groups that received OP with a low or moderate dose of GRE (LG, MG)(OP+LG, OP+MG) (p<0.05). The expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the OP+MG and OP+LG groups was up-regulated compared to the OP+HG groups (p<0.05). The rats in the OP+HG groups had lower levels of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and malondialdehyde (MDA) expression than the rats in the OP+MG and OP+LG groups (p<0.05). This experiment demonstrates that the administration of GRE reverses behavioral dysfunction and prevents AD-like symptoms in our rat model.

Hou R, Zhang X, Zhang Z, He W, Li H, Wang X, Zhao X, Li S, Guan Z, Sun Y, Liu D, Zheng J, Shi M	On-target off-tumor effects precipitate severe adverse reactions in patients, significantly hindering the application of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in both hematological and solid tumors. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive due to the absence of suitable preclinical models. To elucidate these mechanisms, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) transgenic mouse model was developed to investigate CAR-T cell-induced on-target off-tumor effects. CAR-T cells initially migrated to the lungs, targeting alveolar epithelial cells and resulting in interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-dependent acute lung injury. Additionally, a regulatory mechanism involving IFN-γ-induced degradation of Caspase 7 mRNA 5' untranslated regions (UTR), which amplifies acute lung injury mediated by CAR-T cells, was identified. Consequently, a strategy was validated to antagonize IFN-γ during CAR-T cell infusion, thereby mitigating acute lung injury without compromising anti-tumor efficacy. These findings elucidate the mechanisms of CAR-T cell-induced acute lung injury and demonstrate the viability of targeting IFN-γ to prevent this adverse reaction.

CAR-T cells initially migrated to the lungs, targeting alveolar epithelial cells and resulting in interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-dependent acute lung injury. Additionally, a regulatory mechanism involving IFN-γ-induced degradation of Caspase 7 mRNA 5' untranslated regions (UTR), which amplifies acute lung injury mediated by CAR-T cells, was identified. Consequently, a strategy was validated to antagonize IFN-γ during CAR-T cell infusion, thereby mitigating acute lung injury without compromising anti-tumor efficacy. These findings elucidate the mechanisms of CAR-T cell-induced acute lung injury and demonstrate the viability of targeting IFN-γ to prevent this adverse reaction.	ifn γ mediated suppression caspase 7 exacerbate acute lung injury induce car t cell target tumor effect precipitate severe adverse reaction patient significantly hinder application chimeric antigen receptor car t cell hematological solid tumor underlie mechanism remain elusive absence suitable preclinical model to elucidate mechanism human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 her2 transgenic mouse model be develop to investigate car t cell induce target tumor effect car t cell initially migrate lung target alveolar epithelial cell result interferon γ ifn γ)-dependent acute lung injury additionally regulatory mechanism involve ifn γ induced degradation caspase 7 mrna 5 untranslated region utr amplify acute lung injury mediate car t cell be identify consequently strategy be validate to antagonize ifn γ car t cell infusion thereby mitigate acute lung injury compromise anti tumor efficacy finding elucidate mechanism car t cell induce acute lung injury demonstrate viability target ifn γ to prevent adverse reaction

Here, we employed a pooled multiplexing strategy to profile 399,683 gastric cells from 203 Chinese individuals using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We identified 19 distinct gastric cell types and performed eQTL analyses, uncovering 8,498 independent eQTLs, with a considerable fraction (81%, 6,909/8,498) exhibiting cell-type-specific effects. Integration of these eQTLs with genome-wide association studies for gastric cancer (GC) revealed four co-localization signals in specific cell types. Genetically predicted cell-type-specific gene expression identified 15 genes associated with GC risk, including the upregulation of MUC1 exclusively in parietal cells, linked to decreased GC risk. Our findings highlight substantial heterogeneity in the genetic regulation of gene expression across gastric cell types and provide critical cell-type-specific annotations of genetic variants associated with GC risk, offering new molecular insights underlying GC.

10.1016/j.molcel.2025.02.005	A unified model for cohesin function in sisterchromatid cohesion and chromatin loop formation.	Uhlmann F	"The ring-shaped cohesin complex topologically entraps two DNAs to establish sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesin also shapes the interphase chromatin landscape by forming DNA loops, which it is thought to achieve using an in vitro-observed loop extrusion mechanism. However, recent studies revealed that loop-extrusion-deficient cohesin retains its ability to form chromatin loops, suggesting a divergence of in vitro and in vivo loop formation. Instead of loop extrusion, we examine whether cohesin forms chromatin loops by a mechanism akin to sister chromatid cohesion establishment: sequential topological capture of two DNAs. We explore similarities and differences between the ""loop capture"" and the ""loop extrusion"" model, how they compare at explaining experimental observations, and how future approaches can delineate their possible respective contributions. We extend our DNA-DNA capture model for cohesin function to related structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family members, condensin, the Smc5-Smc6 complex, and bacterial SMC complexes."

Su R, Tao X, Yan L, Liu Y, Chen CC, Li P, Li J, Miao J, Liu F, Kuai W, Hou J, Liu M, Mi Y, Xu L	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses a significant global health burden, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) being the predominant etiology in China. However, current diagnostic markers lack the requisite sensitivity and specificity. This study aims to develop and validate serum N-glycomics-based models for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-related cirrhosis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: This study enrolled a total of 397 patients with CHB-related cirrhosis and HCC for clinical management. N-glycomics profiling was conducted on all participants and clinical data were collected. First, machine learning-based models, HCC-GRF and HCC-GSVM, were established for early screening and diagnosis of HCC using N-glycomics. The AUC values in the validation set were 0.967 (95% CI: 0.930-1.000) and 0.908 (0.840-0.976) for HCC-GRF and HCC-GSVM, respectively, outperforming AFP [0.687 (0.575-0.765)] and PIVKA-II [0.665 (0.507-0.823)]. It also showed superiority in subgroups analysis and external validation. Calibration and decision curve analysis also showed good predictive performance. Additionally, we developed a prognostic model, the prog-G model, based on N-glycans to monitor recurrence in HCC patients after curative treatment. During the follow-up period, it was observed that this model correlated with the clinical condition of the patients and could identify all recurrent HCC cases (n=12) prior to imaging findings, outperforming AFP (n=7) and PIVKA-II (n=9), while also detecting recurrent lesions earlier than imaging. CONCLUSIONS: N-glycomics models can effectively predict the occurrence and recurrence of HCC to improving the efficiency of clinical decision-making and promoting the precision treatment of HCC.

This treatment significantly improves outcomes for HR(+), Her2(-), and PIK3CA-mutated metastatic BC patients. However, acquired resistance, often due to aberrant activation of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, remains a significant clinical challenge. Our study, using in vitro and orthotopic xenograft mouse models, demonstrates that constitutively active mTORC1 signaling renders PI3K inhibitor-resistant BC exquisitely sensitive to various drugs targeting cancer metabolism. Mechanistically, mTORC1 suppresses the induction of autophagy during metabolic perturbation, leading to energy stress, a critical depletion of aspartate, and ultimately cell death. Supporting this mechanism, BC cells with CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knockouts of canonical autophagy genes showed similar vulnerability to metabolically active drugs. In BC patients, high mTORC1 activity, indicated by 4E-BP1(T37/46) phosphorylation, correlated with p62 accumulation, a sign of impaired autophagy. Together, these markers predicted poor overall survival in multiple BC subgroups. Our findings reveal that aberrant mTORC1 signaling, a common cause of PI3K inhibitor resistance in BC, creates a druggable metabolic vulnerability by suppressing autophagy. Additionally, the combination of 4E-BP1(T37/46) phosphorylation and p62 accumulation serves as a biomarker for poor overall survival, suggesting their potential utility in identifying BC patients who may benefit from metabolic therapies.

10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.070286	Nrf3-Mediated Mitochondrial Superoxide Promotes Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis and Impairs Cardiac Functions by Suppressing Pitx2.	Chen Q, Zheng A, Xu X, Shi Z, Yang M, Sun S, Wang L, Wang Y, Zhao H, Xiao Q, Zhang L	BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) elicits mitochondria reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cardiomyocyte (CM) apoptosis. Nrf3 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 3) has an established role in regulating redox signaling and tissue homeostasis. Here, we aimed to evaluate the role and mechanism of Nrf3 in injury-induced pathological cardiac remodeling. METHODS: Global (Nrf3-KO) and CM-specific (Nrf3(△CM)) Nrf3 knockout mice were subjected to MI or ischemia/reperfusion injury, followed by functional and histopathological analysis. Primary neonatal mouse and rat ventricular myocytes and CMs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells were used to evaluate the impact of Nrf3 on CM apoptosis and mitochondrial ROS production. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis were used to uncover potential targets of Nrf3. MitoParaquat administration and CM-specific adeno-associated virus vectors were used to further confirm the in vivo relevance of the identified signal pathways. RESULTS: Nrf3 was expressed mainly in CMs in healthy human hearts, and an increased level of Nrf3 was observed in CMs within the border zone of infarcted human hearts and murine cardiac tissues after MI. Both global and CM-specific Nrf3 knockout significantly decreased injury-induced mitochondrial ROS production, CM apoptosis, and pathological cardiac remodeling, consequently improving cardiac functions. In addition, cardiac-specific Nrf3 overexpression reversed the ameliorative cardiac phenotypes observed in Nrf3-KO mice. Functional studies showed that Nrf3 promoted neonatal mouse ventricular myocyte, neonatal rat ventricular myocyte, and CMs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell apoptosis by increasing mitochondrial ROS production. Critically, augmenting mitochondrial ROS with MitoParaquat blunted the beneficial effects of Nrf3 deletion on cardiac function and remodeling. Mechanistically, a redox regulator Pitx2 (paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2) was identified as one of the main target genes of Nrf3. Specifically, Nrf3 binds to Pitx2 promoter, where it increases DNA methylation through recruiting heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K and DNA-methyltransferase 1 complex, thereby inhibiting Pitx2 expression. CM-specific knockdown of Pitx2 blunted the beneficial effects of Nrf3 deletion on cardiac function and remodeling, and cardiac-specific Pitx2 overexpression attenuated MI-induced mitochondrial ROS production and CM apoptosis, as well as preserved cardiac functions after MI. CONCLUSIONS: Nrf3 promotes injury-induced CM apoptosis and deteriorates cardiac functions by increasing mitochondrial ROS production through suppressing Pitx2 expression. Targeting the Nrf3-Pitx2-mitochondrial ROS signal axis may therefore represent a novel therapeutic approach for MI treatment.

Wang Z, Zhu S, Zhu J, Jiang Z, Ren Y	OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of P2Y12 inhibitors versus aspirin monotherapy for secondary prevention in patients with coronary heart disease (CAD), providing evidence for clinical decision-making. METHODS: Following the PRISMA and AMSTAR2 guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing P2Y12 inhibitors and aspirin monotherapy in CAD patients. The inclusion criteria focused on RCTs comparing P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and prasugrel) with aspirin. Studies that were non-randomized, did not focus on monotherapies with these agents, involved patients under 18 years old, or included non-CAD patients were excluded. The primary outcomes included myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, while secondary outcomes comprised gastrointestinal complications, major bleeding, and mortality. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. A random-effects model was applied to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: A total of 31,956 patients were included in the meta-analysis. P2Y12 inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.89, I² = 0%, P < 0.001) and hemorrhagic stroke risk (RR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.92, I² = 20.2%, P = 0.025). No statistically significant difference was observed in major bleeding (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.30, I² = 63.8%, P = 0.814) or all-cause mortality (RR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.15, I² = 30.3%, P = 0.877). Heterogeneity was assessed, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the primary findings. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors reduce risk of myocardial infarction and hemorrhagic stroke in the secondary prevention of CAD. However, there is no significant differences in major bleeding or all-cause mortality. Further research, including subgroup analyses and studies in diverse populations, is needed to validate these findings and explore genetic factors that may influence treatment outcomes.

Further research, including subgroup analyses and studies in diverse populations, is needed to validate these findings and explore genetic factors that may influence treatment outcomes.	comparison p2y12 inhibitor aspirin secondary prevention coronary event meta analysis rcts objective systematic review meta analysis compare efficacy safety p2y12 inhibitor versus aspirin monotherapy secondary prevention patient coronary heart disease cad provide evidence clinical decision making method follow prisma AMSTAR2 guideline comprehensive literature search be conduct pubmed embase web science cochrane library to identify randomize control trial rcts compare p2y12 inhibitor aspirin monotherapy cad patient inclusion criterion focus rct compare p2y12 inhibitor clopidogrel ticagrelor prasugrel aspirin study be non randomized do not focus monotherapie agent involve patient 18 year old include non cad patient be exclude primary outcome include myocardial infarction mi stroke secondary outcome comprise gastrointestinal complication major bleeding mortality cochrane risk bias tool be use to assess risk bias random effect model be apply to calculate risk ratio rr 95 confidence interval ci sensitivity analysis be conduct to evaluate robustness finding result total 31,956 patient be include meta analysis p2y12 inhibitor significantly reduce risk myocardial infarction rr 0.77 95 ci 0.67 to 0.89 i² = 0 p < 0.001 hemorrhagic stroke risk rr 0.53 95 ci 0.30 0.92 i² = 20.2 p = 0.025 statistically significant difference be observe major bleeding rr 0.96 95 ci 0.71 1.30 i² = 63.8 p = 0.814 cause mortality rr 0.99 95 ci 0.85 1.15 i² = 30.3 p = 0.877 heterogeneity be assess sensitivity analysis confirm robustness primary finding conclusion compare aspirin p2y12 inhibitor reduce risk myocardial infarction hemorrhagic stroke secondary prevention cad however be significant difference major bleeding cause mortality further research include subgroup analysis study diverse population be need to validate finding explore genetic factor may influence treatment outcome
10.1210/clinem/dgaf187	Continuous glucose monitoring improves detection of glycemic excursions in hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes.	Galindo RJ, Moazzami B, Gerges A, Flores I, Arevalo G, Peng L, Tuttle KR, Umpierrez GE	BACKGROUND: Optimal glucose management in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on hemodialysis is challenging. We compared the detection of glycemic excursions with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and capillary glucose testing (CBG) in this population. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, insulin-treated adults with T2D on hemodialysis for ≥90 days wore a Dexcom G6-Pro CGM. Participants were instructed to perform CBG up to 4 times daily. We compared differences in glucose metrics and described CGM patterns in relation to dialysis sessions. RESULTS: Among 59 participants (age 57. 7±9years, HbA1c 7.09%), mean glucose measured by CBG and CGM was 165.7 ± 41.8 and 188.9 ± 45.0, with a time-in-range (TIR) of 68%±23 and 51%±26, respectively (p < 0.001). CGM detected that all participants had hyperglycemic episodes of 180mg/dL, with time-above-range (TAR) 180mg/dL of 47.8%±27, and 90% had episodes of >250mg/dL, with TAR >250mg/dL of 20.9%±21.7. CGM detected higher rates of hypoglycemia <70mg/dL, (47% vs. 25%, p=0.005) and <54mg/dL, (25% vs. 12%, p=0.08) than CBG testing. Nocturnal and prolonged hypoglycemia <70mg/dL were only detected by CGM (29% and 12%, respectively). CGM showed a pattern of improved glucose levels on pre-dialysis days, lower glucose levels during hemodialysis, and a rapid rise during the post-dialysis period. CONCLUSIONS: In participants with T2D and ESKD on hemodialysis, CGM improved the detection of hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic events, particularly nocturnal and prolonged episodes. CGM revealed distinct glycemic patterns related to dialysis sessions, potentially enabling more personalized management.

METHODS: The Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, treat-through GRAVITI study randomized 347 participants 1:1:1 to guselkumab 400mg SC q4w→100mg SC every 8 weeks (q8w) (n=115), guselkumab 400mg SC every 4 weeks (q4w)→200mg SC q4w (n=115), or placebo (n=117). Placebo participants meeting rescue criteria received guselkumab from week 16 onward. Co-primary endpoints were clinical remission at week 12 and endoscopic response at week 12. Additional multiplicity-controlled endpoints were Patient Reported Outcome-2 remission (week 12), clinical response (week 12), clinical remission (week 24), clinical remission (week 48), and endoscopic response (week 48). Safety was assessed through week 48. RESULTS: All multiplicity-controlled endpoints were met. At week 12, significantly greater proportions of participants receiving guselkumab 400mg achieved clinical remission versus placebo (56.1% vs 21.4%; Δ=34.9; p<0.001), and endoscopic response versus placebo (41.3% vs 21.4%; Δ=19.9; p<0.001). At week 48, significantly greater proportions of participants in both guselkumab groups (100mg SC q8w: 60.0%, Δ=42.8; 200mg SC q4w: 66.1%, Δ=48.9) achieved clinical remission versus placebo (17.1%; p<0.001 each) and endoscopic response (44.3%, Δ=37.5; 51.3%, Δ=44.6; versus placebo 6.8%; p<0.001 each). Efficacy was observed in both bionaive participants and those with inadequate response/intolerance to biologics. Adverse event rates were not greater in guselkumab groups versus placebo.

10.1001/jama.2025.0310	Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Review.	Chebib FT, Hanna C, Harris PC, Torres VE, Dahl NK	IMPORTANCE: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by progressive development of kidney cysts and is the most common inherited kidney disorder worldwide. ADPKD accounts for 5% to 10% of kidney failure in the US and Europe, and its prevalence in the US is 9.3 per 10 000 individuals. OBSERVATIONS: ADPKD is typically diagnosed in individuals aged 27 to 42 years and is primarily caused by pathogenic variants in the PKD1 (78%) or PKD2 (15%) genes. Most persons with ADPKD have an affected parent, but de novo disease is suggested in 10% to 25% of families. More than 90% of patients older than 35 years have hepatic cysts, which may cause abdominal discomfort and occasionally require medical or surgical intervention. Hypertension affects 70% to 80% of patients with ADPKD, and approximately 9% to 14% develop intracranial aneurysms, which have a rupture rate of 0.57 per 1000 patient-years. Approximately 50% of individuals with ADPKD require kidney replacement therapy by 62 years of age. The severity of kidney disease can be quantified using the Mayo Imaging Classification (MIC), which stratifies patients based on total kidney volume adjusted for height and age and ranges from 1A to 1E. Patients with MIC 1C to MIC 1E have larger kidneys because of more rapid growth (6%-10% per year) compared with those with MIC 1A and 1B (1%-5% per year) and have earlier progression to kidney replacement therapy, which occurs at a mean age of 58.4 years for MIC 1C, 52.5 years for MIC 1D, and 43.4 years for MIC 1E. Optimal management of ADPKD includes systolic blood pressure lower than 120 mm Hg for most patients, but lower than 110/75 mm Hg for patients with MIC 1C to 1E who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and are younger than 50 years, dietary sodium restriction (<2000 mg/d), weight management, and adequate hydration (>2.5 L daily). The vasopressin type 2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan reduces the annual rate of eGFR decline by 0.98 to 1.27 mL/min/1.73 m2 and is indicated for patients with MIC 1C to 1E or an eGFR decline greater than 3 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year to slow disease progression and delay the onset of kidney failure. CONCLUSION: ADPKD is the most common genetic kidney disease worldwide and is characterized by progressive development of kidney cysts. Patients typically have hypertension and liver cysts, and 9% to 14% develop intracranial aneurysms. First-line treatment includes blood pressure control, dietary and weight management, and adequate hydration. Tolvaptan reduces the rate of eGFR decline for those at high risk of rapid progression to kidney failure.	JAMA	24/03/2025	Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Review..

10.1136/gutjnl-2024-333657	Diagnostic efficacy of an extracellular vesicle-derived lncRNA-based liquid biopsy signature for the early detection of early-onset gastric cancer.	Guo X, Wang W, Cheng X, Song Q, Wang X, Wei J, Xu S, Lv X, Ji G	BACKGROUND: Early-onset gastric cancer (EOGC) is a lethal malignancy. It differs from late-onset gastric cancer (LOGC) in clinical and molecular characteristics. The current strategies for EOGC detection have certain limitations in diagnostic performance due to the rising trend in EOGC. OBJECTIVE: We developed a liquid biopsy signature for EOGC detection. DESIGN: We use a systematic discovery approach by analysing genome-wide transcriptomic profiling data from EOGC (n=43), LOGC (n=31) and age-matched non-disease controls (n=37) tissue samples. An extracellular vesicle-derived long non-coding RNA (EV-lncRNA) signature was identified in blood samples from a training cohort (n=299), and subsequently confirmed by qPCR in two external validation cohorts (n=462 and n=438), a preoperative/postoperative cohort (n=66) and a gastrointestinal tumour cohort (n=225). RESULTS: A three EV-lncRNA (NALT1, PTENP1 and HOTTIP) liquid biopsy signature was developed for EOGC detection with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.924 (95% CI 0.889 to 0.953). This EV-lncRNA signature provided robust diagnostic performance in two external validation cohorts (Xi'an cohort: AUROC, 0.911; Beijing cohort: AUROC, 0.9323). Furthermore, the EV-lncRNA signature reliably identified resectable stage EOGC patients (stage I/II) and demonstrated better diagnostic performance than traditional GC-related biomarkers in distinguishing early-stage EOGC (stage I) from precancerous lesions. The low levels of this biomarker in postsurgery and other gastrointestinal tumour plasma samples indicated its GC specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed EV-lncRNA signature effectively identified EOGC patients at a resectable stage with enhanced precision, thereby improving the prognosis of patients who would have otherwise missed the curative treatment window.

10.1016/j.bcp.2025.116887	Histone lactylation facilitates MCM7 expression to maintain stemness and radio-resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Liu Z, Han J, Su S, Zeng Q, Wu Z, Yuan J, Yang J	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play an essential role in tumor initiation and therapy resistance. Histone lactylation as a novel epigenetic modification could regulate the gene transcription process during tumor progression. Nevertheless, researches have not well examined its role in maintaining CSC properties. Our study identified Minichromosome maintenance complex component 7 (MCM7) as a candidate gene in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with diagnostic and prognostic values, and Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot (WB), and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays ascertained its obviously higher expressions in HCC cells and tissues. Ectopic of MCM7 could increase the expression of CSC-related genes and enhance spheroid both in size and in number. Suppression of MCM7 could strengthen the efficacy of radiotherapy verified by Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. The subcutaneous xenograft model indicated that suppression of MCM7 could inhibit CSC properties and the efficacy of radiotherapy in vivo. Mechanistically, histone lactylation could facilitate MCM7 expression, and both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level of MCM7 expression presented an obvious decrease due to 2-DG (glycolysis inhibitor) treatment and an obvious increase due to Rotenone (glycolysis activator) treatment. Rescue experiments verified that histone lactylation was necessary for MCM7 to promote CSC properties and radio-resistance in HCC. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) targeting MCM7 could inhibit the CSC phenotypes and enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, histone lactylation could transcriptionally activate MCM7 to accelerate proliferation and radio-resistance through enhancing CSC properties. ATO targeting MCM7 could inhibit CSCs phenotypes and synergistically increase the efficacy of radiation therapy.

10.1016/j.redox.2025.103579	The tryptophan metabolite 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid alleviates hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia via inhibiting ferroptosis.	Ruan Q, Peng Y, Yi X, Yang J, Ai Q, Liu X, He Y, Shi Y	Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a prevalent chronic respiratory condition in preterm infants with an increasing incidence, severely affecting their survival rate and quality of life. Exploring the underlying mechanisms of BPD helps to develop novel effective therapeutic strategies. In this study, integrated metabolomic analyses of tracheal aspirates (TAs) from BPD infants and non-BPD infants, along with lung tissues from hyperoxia-induced experimental BPD neonatal rats and control rats, demonstrated that BPD was associated with a significant reduction in 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), which was confirmed to be partly caused by tryptophan-metabolizing enzyme disorders. In vivo and in vitro models were subsequently established to assess the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of 3-HAA in relation to BPD. Compared with the BPD group, 3-HAA nebulization improved lung development and suppressed inflammation in rats. Limited proteolysis-small molecule mapping (LiP-SMap) proteomic analysis revealed the involvement of the ferroptosis pathway in the underlying mechanism by which 3-HAA alleviated hyperoxia-induced BPD injury. Ferroptosis was identified by detecting Fe(2+) levels, malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-HNE, total aldehydes, mitochondrial morphology, ferroptosis-associated protein and mRNA expression, and this dysregulation was indeed ameliorated by 3-HAA nebulization in vivo. Furthermore, a combination of LiP-SMap, molecular docking, SPR and Co-IP analyses confirmed that 3-HAA can bind directly to FTH1 and disrupt the nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-FTH1 interaction. In conclusion, our study is the first to reveal that BPD is linked to the reduction of 3-HAA, and 3-HAA could inhibit the ferroptosis pathway by targeting FTH1, thereby alleviating hyperoxia-induced injury in rats and alveolar type II epithelial cells, highlighting the potential of targeting 3-HAA and ferroptosis for clinical applications in BPD.

10.1186/s12876-025-03765-7	Factors influencing the incidence of early gastric cancer: a bayesian network analysis.	Li R, Yang T, Dong Z, Gao Y, Li N, Song T, Sun J, Chen Y	BACKGROUND: This study aims to establish a Bayesian network risk prediction model for gastric cancer using data mining methods. It explores both direct and indirect factors influencing the incidence of gastric cancer and reveals the interrelationships among these factors. METHODS: Data were collected from early cancer screenings conducted at the People's Hospital of Lincang between 2022 and 2023. Initial variable selection was performed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) and Sliding Windows Sequential Forward Selection (SWSFS), and the screened variables and demographic characteristics features were used as variables for constructing the Bayesian network (BN) model. Subsequently, the performance of the models was evaluated, and the optimal model was selected for network mapping and Bayesian inference using the best model. RESULTS: The incidence rate of gastric cancer in this region's high-risk population was determined to be 7.09%. The BN model constructed from the set of variables consisting of Lasso's selection variables and demographic characteristics had better performance. A total of 12 variables were incorporated into the BN model to form a network structure consisting of 13 nodes and 18 edges. The model shows that age, gender, ethnicity, current address, upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, acid reflux, vomiting), alcohol consumption, smoking, SGIM gastritis, and family history are important risk factors for gastric cancer development. CONCLUSION: The Bayesian network model provides an intuitive framework for understanding the direct and indirect factors contributing to the early onset of gastric cancer, elucidating the interrelationships among these factors. Furthermore, the model demonstrates satisfactory predictive performance, which may facilitate the early detection of gastric cancer and enhance the levels of early diagnosis and treatment among high-risk populations.

However, little is known about its genome-wide distribution and its association with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Here, we report a genome-wide profiling of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in 1079 autopsied brains (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) of older individuals and assess its association with multiple measures of Alzheimer's disease pathologies, including pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-β load, and PHFtau tangle density. Of 197,765 5-hydroxymethylcytosine regions detected, we identified 2821 differentially hydroxymethylated regions associated with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology after controlling for multiple testing and covariates.

Zhong S, Xiao R, Lin Y, Xie B, Sun J	BACKGROUND: The causal relationship between leisure sedentary behaviors (LSBs) and chronic kidney disease, diabetes and related complications is still equivocal. In this study, we performed two-sample Mendelian randomization for declaring the potential causal association between LSBs and these diseases and summarized the causal estimates. METHODS: In this study, we used GWAS summary statistics from the public database for exposures (LSB: television watching, computer use, and driving) and outcomes (chronic kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus, and related complications). To ensure reliable results for this study, we applied several methods including IVW, MR-Egger, and weighted median for the regression process; MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran's Q test, 'leave-one-out' analysis and MR-PRESSO test were used to detect horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity for sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Television watching was harmful of CKD (OR = 1.26, 95%CI 1.09-1.44; p = 0.0011), T2D (OR = 1.82, 95%CI 1.48-2.24; p = 1.67e - 08) and DM (OR = 2.26, 95%CI 1.75-2.93; p = 6.44e - 10). No horizontal pleiotropy was detected in MR-Egger intercept test (p value > 0.05) and there were no influential SNPs based on 'leave-one-out' analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization estimates in our study genetically predicted the causal effect between television watching and CKD, T2D, and DM. However, we cannot get the definitive causal effect of television watching and other related complications, further studies need to be done to explore the mechanism of action of sedentary behavior on the complications of diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

Coorens THH, Collord G, Jung H, Wang Y, Moore L, Hooks Y, Mahbubani K, Law SYK, Yan HHN, Yuen ST, Saeb-Parsy K, Campbell PJ, Martincorena I, Leung SY, Stratton MR	The landscapes of somatic mutation in normal cells inform us about the processes of mutation and selection operative throughout life, providing insight into normal ageing and the earliest stages of cancer development(1). Here, by whole-genome sequencing of 238 microdissections(2) from 30 individuals, including 18 with gastric cancer, we elucidate the developmental trajectories of normal and malignant gastric epithelium. We find that gastric glands are units of monoclonal cell populations that accrue roughly 28 somatic single-nucleotide variants per year, predominantly attributable to endogenous mutational processes. In individuals with gastric cancer, metaplastic glands often show elevated mutation burdens due to acceleration of mutational processes linked to proliferation and oxidative damage. Unusually for normal cells, gastric epithelial cells often carry recurrent trisomies of specific chromosomes, which are highly enriched in a subset of individuals. Surveying 829 polyclonal gastric microbiopsies by targeted sequencing, we find somatic 'driver' mutations in a distinctive repertoire of known cancer genes, including ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2, CTNNB1 and KDM6A. The prevalence of mutant clones increases with age to occupy roughly 8% of the gastric epithelial lining by age 60 years and is significantly increased by the presence of severe chronic inflammation. Our findings provide insights into intrinsic and extrinsic influences on somatic evolution in the gastric epithelium in healthy, precancerous and malignant states.

Chaikin CA, Thakkar AV, Steffeck AWT, Pfrender EM, Hung K, Zhu P, Waldeck NJ, Nozawa R, Song W, Futtner CR, Quattrocelli M, Bass J, Ben-Sahra I, Peek CB	Disruptions of circadian rhythms are widespread in modern society and lead to accelerated and worsened symptoms of metabolic syndrome. In healthy mice, the circadian clock factor BMAL1 is required for skeletal muscle function and metabolism. However, the importance of muscle BMAL1 in the development of metabolic diseases, such as diet-induced obesity (DIO), remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that skeletal muscle-specific BMAL1-deficient mice exhibit worsened glucose tolerance upon high-fat diet feeding, despite no evidence of increased weight gain. Metabolite profiling from Bmal1-deficient muscles revealed impaired glucose utilization specifically at early steps in glycolysis that dictate the switch between anabolic and catabolic glucose fate. We provide evidence that this is due to abnormal control of the nutrient stress-responsive hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. Genetic HIF1α stabilization in muscle Bmal1-deficient mice restores glucose tolerance and expression of 217/736 dysregulated genes during DIO, including glycolytic enzymes. Together, these data indicate that during DIO, skeletal muscle BMAL1 is an important regulator of HIF-driven glycolysis and metabolic flexibility, which influences the development of high-fat-diet-induced glucose intolerance.

10.1038/s41419-025-07537-9	LL37 complexed to double-stranded RNA induces RIG-I-like receptor signalling and Gasdermin E activation facilitating IL-36γ release from keratinocytes.	Keller J, Danis J, Krehl I, Girousi E, Satoh TK, Meier-Schiesser B, Kemény L, Széll M, Wong WW, Pascolo S, French LE, Kündig TM, Mellett M	The Interleukin-36 (IL-36) cytokine family have emerged as important players in mounting an inflammatory response at epithelial barriers and tailoring appropriate adaptive immune responses. As members of the Interleukin-1 superfamily, IL-36 cytokines lack a signal peptide for conventional secretion and require extracellular proteolysis to generate bioactive cytokines. Although the IL-36 family plays an important role in the pathogenesis of plaque and pustular psoriasis, little is known about the release mechanisms of these cytokines from keratinocytes and the physiological stimuli involved. Nucleic acid released from damaged or dying keratinocytes initiates early inflammatory signals that result in the breaking of tolerance associated with psoriasis pathogenesis onset. Cathelicidin peptide, LL37 binds to DNA or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and activates a type I Interferon responses in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and keratinocytes. Here, we demonstrate that LL37 binds to dsRNA and induces IL-36γ release from human primary keratinocytes. LL37/dsRNA complexes activate RIG-I-like Receptor signalling, resulting in Caspase-3 and Gasdermin E (GSDME) cleavage. Subsequent GSDME pore formation facilitates IL-36γ release. This response is magnified by priming with psoriasis-associated cytokines, IL-17A and IFNγ. IL-36γ release in this manner is largely independent of cell death in primary keratinocytes and lacked extracellular proteolysis of IL-36γ. Conversely, transfection of keratinocytes directly with dsRNA synthetic analogue, Poly(I:C) induces NLRP1 inflammasome activation, which facilitates IL-36γ expression and release in a GSDMD-dependent manner. Inflammasome-associated cell death also enables extracellular processing of IL-36γ by the release of keratinocyte-derived proteases. These data highlight the distinct responses triggered by dsRNA sensors in keratinocytes. Depending on the inflammatory context and magnitude of the exogenous threat, keratinocytes will release IL-36γ coupled with cell death and extracellular cleavage or release the inactive pro-form, which requires subsequent processing by neutrophil proteases to unleash full biological activity, as occurring in psoriatic skin.

Cell death & disease	22/03/2025	LL37 complexed to double-stranded RNA induces RIG-I-like receptor signalling and Gasdermin E activation facilitating IL-36γ release from keratinocytes.. The Interleukin-36 (IL-36) cytokine family have emerged as important players in mounting an inflammatory response at epithelial barriers and tailoring appropriate adaptive immune responses. As members of the Interleukin-1 superfamily, IL-36 cytokines lack a signal peptide for conventional secretion and require extracellular proteolysis to generate bioactive cytokines. Although the IL-36 family plays an important role in the pathogenesis of plaque and pustular psoriasis, little is known about the release mechanisms of these cytokines from keratinocytes and the physiological stimuli involved. Nucleic acid released from damaged or dying keratinocytes initiates early inflammatory signals that result in the breaking of tolerance associated with psoriasis pathogenesis onset. Cathelicidin peptide, LL37 binds to DNA or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and activates a type I Interferon responses in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and keratinocytes. Here, we demonstrate that LL37 binds to dsRNA and induces IL-36γ release from human primary keratinocytes.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of inhaled sevoflurane compared with intravenous propofol for sedation in patients with ARDS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Phase 3 randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded clinical trial conducted from May 2020 to October 2023 with 90-day follow-up. Adults with early moderate to severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of Pao2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen of <150 mm Hg with a positive end-expiratory pressure of ≥8 cm H2O) were enrolled in 37 French intensive care units. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to a strategy of inhaled sedation with sevoflurane (intervention group) or to a strategy of intravenous sedation with propofol (control group) for up to 7 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the number of ventilator-free days at 28 days; the key secondary end point was 90-day survival. RESULTS: Of 687 patients enrolled (mean [SD] age, 65 [12] years; 30% female), 346 were randomized to sevoflurane and 341 to propofol. The median total duration of sedation was 7 days (IQR, 4 to 7) in both groups. The number of ventilator-free days through day 28 was 0.0 days (IQR, 0.0 to 11.9) in the sevoflurane group and 0.0 days (IQR, 0.0 to 18.7) in the propofol group (median difference, -2.1 [95% CI, -3.6 to -0.7]; standardized hazard ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.97]). The 90-day survival rates were 47.1% and 55.7% in the sevoflurane and propofol groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.62]). Among 4 secondary outcomes, sevoflurane was associated with higher 7-day mortality (19.4% vs 13.5%, respectively; relative risk, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.02 to 2.03]) and fewer intensive care unit-free days through day 28 (median, 0.0 [IQR, 0.0 to 6.0] vs 0.0 [IQR, 0.0 to 15.0]; median difference, -2.5 [95% CI, -3.7 to -1.4]) compared with propofol.

Meng X, Li W, Xu J, Yao Y, Gong A, Yang Y, Qu F, Guo C, Zheng H, Cui G, Suo S, Peng G	The functional development of the mammalian lung is a complex process that relies on the spatial and temporal organization of multiple cell types and their states. However, a comprehensive spatiotemporal transcriptome atlas of the developing lung has not yet been reported. Here we apply high-throughput spatial transcriptomics to allow for a comprehensive assessment of mouse lung development comprised of two critical developmental events: branching morphogenesis and alveologenesis. We firstly generate a spatial molecular atlas of mouse lung development spanning from E12.5 to P0 based on the integration of published single cell RNA-sequencing data and identify 10 spatial domains critical for functional lung organization. Furthermore, we create a lineage trajectory connecting spatial clusters from adjacent time points in E12.5-P0 lungs and explore TF (transcription factor) regulatory networks for each lineage specification. We observe the establishment of pulmonary airways within the developing lung, accompanied by the proximal-distal patterning with distinct characteristics of gene expression, signaling landscape and transcription factors enrichment. We characterize the alveolar niche heterogeneity with maturation state differences during the later developmental stage around birth and demonstrate differentially expressed genes, such as Angpt2 and Epha3, which may perform a critical role during alveologenesis. In addition, multiple signaling pathways, including ANGPT, VEGF and EPHA, exhibit increased levels in more maturing alveolar niche. Collectively, by integrating the spatial transcriptome with corresponding single-cell transcriptome data, we provide a comprehensive molecular atlas of mouse lung development with detailed molecular domain annotation and communication, which would pave the way for understanding human lung development and respiratory regeneration medicine.

Liao Y, Niu L, Ling J, Cui Y, Huang Z, Xu J, Jiang Y, Yu P, Liu X	Lactylation, a recently identified posttranslational modification (PTM), has emerged as a critical regulatory mechanism in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This PTM involves the addition of lactyl groups to lysine residues on histones and nonhistone proteins, influencing gene expression and cellular metabolism. The discovery of lactylation has revealed new directions for understanding metabolic and immune processes, particularly in the context of CVDs. This review describes the intricate roles of specific lactylated proteins and enzymes, such as H3K18, HMGB1, MCT1/4, and LDH, in the regulation of cardiovascular pathology.

Pauken KE, Alhalabi O, Goswami S, Sharma P	"While immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) has revolutionized cancer treatment, most patients with advanced disease fail to achieve durable benefit. To address this challenge, it is essential to integrate mechanistic research with clinical studies to: (1) understand response mechanisms, (2) identify patient-specific resistance pathways, (3) develop biomarkers for patient selection, and (4) design novel therapies to overcome resistance. We propose that incorporating ""direct-in-patient"" studies into clinical trials is crucial for bridging the gap between fundamental science and clinical oncology. In this review, we first highlight recent clinical success of ICT in the neoadjuvant setting, where treatment is given in earlier disease stages to improve outcomes. We then explore how neoadjuvant clinical trials could be utilized to drive mechanistic laboratory-based investigations.

Tu Y, Chen Y, Mo L, Yan G, Xie J, Ji X, Chen S, Niu C, Liao P	"OBJECTIVE: Lipid metabolic reprogramming is closely intertwined with the development and progression of thyroid carcinoma (TC); however, its specific mechanism remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate the association between lipid metabolism and TC progression. METHODS: We employed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) for an untargeted metabolomics analysis, comparing 12 TC patients and 12 healthy controls (HC). Additionally, we conducted the screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and identified differentially expressed lipid metabolism genes (LMGs). Multi-omic findings related to lipid metabolism were integrated to establish a prognostic risk model. The resulting risk score stratified TC patients into high- and low-risk groups. Overall survival (O.S.) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis. The immune landscape was evaluated using the CIBERSORT algorithm, and chemotherapeutic response was predicted utilizing the ""pRRophetic"" R package. RESULTS: Our metabolomic analysis revealed heightened lipid metabolic activity in TC, corroborated by similar findings in transcriptomic analysis. Multi-omic analysis identified key LMGs (FABP4, PPARGC1A, AGPAT4, ALDH1A1, TGFA, and GPAT3) associated with fatty acids and glycerophospholipids metabolism. A novel risk model, incorporating these LMGs, confirmed significantly worse O.S. (p = 0.0045) in the high-risk group based on TCGA_THCA. Furthermore, high-risk TC patients exhibited lower immune cell infiltration, and predictive outcomes indicated the efficacy of potential therapeutic drugs across risk groups. CONCLUSION: This multi-omic analysis underscores the potential utility of the lipid metabolism risk model in guiding clinical treatment and improving outcomes for TC patients."

10.1186/s12885-025-13954-y	NDRG1 alleviates Erastin-induced ferroptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.	Li L, Wu T, Gong G, Li B, Feng J, Xu L, Zhao H, Gao X	BACKGROUND: NDRG1, a cell differentiation-associated factor, has recently emerged as a regulator ferroptosis. Nevertheless, its role in modulating ferroptosis within hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains uncharacterized. METHODS: The differential expression of NDRG1 and its prognostic value were analyzed in HCC using data from TCGA and GEO. Ferroptosis in HepG2 and Huh7 cells was assessed using flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, and propidium iodide staining following NDRG1 knockdown using shRNA. RNA-seq was performed to characterize the mRNA expression profiles in HepG2 cells, identifying differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNAs) and NDRG1-related hub genes. RESULTS: NDRG1 was overexpressed in multiple malignant tumors, including HCC, and was associated with a significantly poor prognosis in HCC patients. A nomogram model integrating NDRG1 expression and clinical parameters demonstrated robust prognostic accuracy. NDRG1 knockdown potentiated erastin-induced alterations in Fe(2+), total ROS, lipid ROS, and ferroptosis markers (PTGS2, ACSL4, GPX4, SLC7A11, GSH, GSSG), while exacerbating mitochondrial ultrastructural damage in HepG2 and Huh7 cells. Erastin induction elicited 1,056 DE-mRNAs, while subsequent NDRG1 knockdown revealed 1,323 DE-mRNAs in HepG2 cells. These DE-mRNAs are mainly involved in metastasis, immunity, growth, ferroptosis, and are associated with AMPK, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT pathways. Moreover, NDRG1 potentially interacted with HSPA8, CDH1, ALDOC, ANGPTL4, ANKRD37, CA9, ERBB3, FOS. qRT-PCR confirmed their expression changes consistent with RNA-seq. CONCLUSION: NDRG1 exhibits strong predictive value for HCC, and accelerates tumor progression by suppressing ferroptosis.

10.1016/j.annonc.2025.03.007	The impact of the immunological context on outcomes of solid cancer patients treated with genotype-matched targeted therapies: a comprehensive review.	Mubarak O, Middleton G	INTRODUCTION: Outcomes with genotype-matched targeted therapy in solid cancer patients are heterogeneous: some have exceptional responses, others primary progression. This review explores the immunobiological features which may underlie this differential response. METHODS: We conducted a literature review of studies assessing impact of immune context following searches on Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Relevant outcomes include response, progression-free survival and overall survival. Data was extracted from multivariate analysis, univariate analysis or directly from Kaplan-Meier curves. Meta-analyses were performed where three or more studies analysed the same immune factor for the same cancer type. Remaining studies were analysed descriptively. RESULTS: In the adjuvant setting assessment of the immune context does not highlight a group failing to derive benefit for the use of dabrafenib/trametinib after resection of BRAFV600E melanoma Differential gene expression in exceptional responders show enrichment of genes associated with immune activation. BRAFV600E colorectal cancer patients with high cytolytic scores benefit from the addition of MEK inhibition whereas those with low scores fare better without. High PD-L1 expression is predictive of inferior outcomes to EGFR, ALK and G12C tyrosine kinase inhibitors. EGFR-mutant patients with high CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 positivity have very poor outcomes. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes predicts for efficacy of stromal-poor tumours in HER-2+ breast cancer treated with short-course adjuvant trastuzumab. High immune metagene and single immune gene expression is predictive of benefit for chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, but not chemotherapy alone. The addition of pertuzumab or lapatanib appears to be beneficial in those with immune non-enriched microenvironments. High MHCI is negatively and high MHCII positively predictive of outcome with trastuzumab-based therapy. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first review assessing immunological context as biomarker for targeted therapy. The results of this review represent an important resource to aid future translational studies in advancing stratified precision medicine oncology.

Whether neurogenesis in the hypothalamus, a region critical for controlling appetite, is regulated by m(6)A signaling, especially in humans, remains unclear. Here, we showed that deletion of m(6)A writer Mettl14 in the mouse embryonic hypothalamus led to adult obesity, with impaired glucose-insulin homeostasis and increased energy intake. Mechanistically, deletion of Mettl14 leads to hypothalamic arcuate nucleus neurogenesis deficits with reduced generation of feeding-related neurons and dysregulation of neurogenesis-related m(6)A-tagged transcripts. Deletion of m(6)A writer Mettl3 or m(6)A reader Ythdc1 shared similar phenotypes. METTL14 or YTHDC1 knockdown also led to reduced generation of feeding-related neurons in human brain subregion-specific arcuate nucleus organoids.

10.1186/s12933-025-02676-x	"Accelerometer-derived ""weekend warrior"" physical activity pattern and incident type 2 diabetes."	Cao Z, Min J, Xu C	BACKGROUND: The guidelines provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend a minimum of 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for optimal overall health benefits. However, it remains unclear whether there are differential effects on the risk of incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) between concentrated and evenly distributed physical activity (PA) patterns. We aimed to investigate the associations of accelerometer-derived weekend warrior and regularly active pattern with risk of T2D. METHODS: A total of 84,656 general participants from the UK Biobank with validated accelerometry data and free of T2D was included. Data on PA was collected using the Axivity AX3 wrist-based triaxial accelerometer worn for one week. Participants were categorized into three PA patterns: inactive (< 150 min/week of MVPA), weekend warrior (≥ 150 min/week with ≥ 50% of total MVPA occurring within 1-2 days), and regularly active (≥ 150 min/week but not meeting weekend warrior criteria). RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 8.4 years, 2464 cases of T2D were documented. In multivariable-adjusted models, the weekend warrior pattern (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.84) and the regularly active pattern (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.94) exhibited a comparable lower risk of T2D compared to physically inactive participants. When stratified by genetic risk score (PRS) of T2D, the weekend warrior pattern was associated with T2D in the higher PRS group (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.91), intermediate PRS group (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.97) and lowest PRS group (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43-0.80). CONCLUSIONS: Engaging in the weekend warrior pattern is associated with a similarly lower risk of T2D to the regularly active pattern, even among individuals with high genetic risk. These findings highlight the weekend warrior pattern as a significant and flexible alternative in preventive intervention strategies for T2D, particularly for those unable to maintain daily activity routines.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the associations of NCIT and NCRT with tumor regression and long-term survival in patients with locally advanced ESCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this comparative effectiveness research study, from January 2016 to March 2023, patients with locally advanced ESCC who underwent esophagectomy following NCRT or NCIT were identified from a prospective database of 8 high-volume esophageal surgery centers in China. Follow-up began on the date of surgery and continued until the last recorded contact or March 2024, whichever occurred first. Data were analyzed between April and September 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end points were 2-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary end points included major pathologic response (MPR) and pathologic complete response (pCR). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to investigate the risk factors for OS and DFS. RESULTS: The study included 1428 patients (median [IQR] age, 63 [57-68] years; 1184 men [82.9%]), with 704 patients in the NCRT group and 724 patients in the NCIT group. After propensity score matching, there were 532 patients in each group. The 2-year OS (81.3% vs 71.3%; hazard ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.26-1.96; P < .001) and DFS (73.9% vs 63.4%; hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.11-1.69; P < .001) rates were significantly higher in NCIT group than in the NCRT group. The NCRT group had a higher MPR rate than that of the NCIT group (71.8% vs 61.5%), whereas the pCR rates were similar (25.9% vs 22.9%). Multivariable Cox analysis demonstrated that NCIT and MPR were independently associated with both OS and DFS. The NCIT group exhibited a lower overall recurrence rate (126 patients [23.7%] vs 190 patients [35.7%]) and distant metastasis rate (72 patients [13.5%] vs 133 patients [25.0%]), although locoregional metastasis rates were similar (98 patients [18.4%] vs 111 patients [20.9%]). Better OS and DFS were obtained for the NCIT group than for the NCRT group, regardless of whether adjuvant immunotherapy was given. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with NCRT, patients with locally advanced ESCC receiving NCIT had better 2-year OS and DFS. The decrease in distant metastasis may be the main reason, but further prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to verify this finding.

10.1126/sciadv.adt2117	CD38-mediated metabolic reprogramming promotes the stability and suppressive function of regulatory T cells in tumor.	Sarkar I, Basak D, Ghosh P, Gautam A, Bhoumik A, Singh P, Kar A, Mahanti S, Chowdhury S, Chakraborty L, Mondal S, Mukherjee R, Mehrotra S, Majumder S, Sengupta S, Paul S, Chatterjee S	In the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulatory T cells (T(regs)) adapt their metabolism to thrive in low-glucose, high-lactate conditions, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Our study identifies CD38 as a key regulator of this adaptation by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD(+)), redirecting lactate-derived pyruvate toward phosphoenolpyruvate and bypassing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This prevents accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which destabilizes T(regs) by inducing hypermethylation at the Foxp3 locus. Restoring NAD(+) with nicotinamide mononucleotide reverses this adaptation, pushing T(regs) back to the TCA cycle and reducing their suppressive function. In YUMM1.7 melanoma-bearing mice, small-molecule CD38 inhibition selectively destabilizes intratumoral T(regs), sparking robust antitumor immunity. These findings reveal that targeting the CD38-NAD(+) axis disrupts T(regs) metabolic adaptation and offers a strategy to enhance antitumor responses.

10.1002/epi4.70021	Real-world effectiveness and tolerability of cenobamate in drug-resistant epilepsy: A retrospective analysis of the patients included into the Early Access Programs (EAP) in Germany, France, and United Kingdom.	Rheims S, Steinhoff BJ, Hirsch E, Rosenow F, Biraben A, Thomas R, Lovera A, Lipone P, Comandini A, Benoist C, Baron EA, Leach JP, Thangavelu K, Cattaneo A	OBJECTIVE: Investigate real-world outcomes in drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients treated with cenobamate as adjunctive treatment to other antiseizure medications (ASMs) within the Early Access Programs (EAP) in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. METHODS: DRE adults with uncontrolled focal-onset seizures were included from 19 hospitals participating in the EAP in this retrospective study. Data were sourced from clinical records. Participants were evaluated at baseline, 1 months, and 3 months from cenobamate start, and 3, 6, and 12 months after maintenance. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the 50% responder rate, defined as the reduction in seizure frequency ≥50%. RESULTS: Data were collected from 298 patients who received at least one dose of cenobamate; efficacy was evaluated on 216 patients with seizure data available. At baseline, the median epilepsy duration was 22.2 years, and 41.9% of patients had previous epilepsy surgery, including vagus nerve stimulation, with a median of nine previously failed ASMs. The median number of seizures/month was 8.8. After 3 months of maintenance, the 50% responder rate (primary endpoint) was 49.3%; the median percentage seizure reduction from baseline was 49.1%. A total of 100%, ≥90%, and ≥75% seizures reduction were reported in 13.6%, 20.0%, and 33.6% of patients, respectively. Both the responder rate and the median percentage seizure reduction steadily increased during the observation period. At 6-month maintenance, the seizure-free rate was 24.2%. The retention rate assessed by Kaplan-Meier decreased from 96.6% at 1-month cenobamate start to 69.7% at 12-month maintenance. Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) to cenobamate occurred in 30.9% of patients, with asthenia, dizziness, and somnolence being the most frequent; the majority were mild-to-moderate and resolved during the observation period; three patients (1.0%) experienced a total of seven serious ADRs, all during titration. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, cenobamate demonstrated to be an effective option for people with uncontrolled epilepsy even after multiple failed ASMs or failure of epilepsy surgery. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: This study involved patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, who had continued seizures despite using at least two antiseizure medications (ASMs). Patients received cenobamate (Ontozry) as epilepsy treatment during the Early Access Program (EAP) in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. An EAP allows patients to receive promising new drugs under clinical supervision before they are commercially available. After 6 months from cenobamate start, 49.3% of patients had their seizures cut by half or more, and 13.6% became seizure-free. A total of 30.9% of patients had an undesirable reaction to cenobamate, mostly mild-to-moderate and resolved; the most frequent were asthenia, dizziness, and somnolence.

Hajare AD, Dagar N, Gaikwad AB	Klotho, initially introduced as an anti-aging protein, is expressed in the brain, pancreas, and most prominently in the kidney. The two forms of Klotho (membrane-bound and soluble form) have diverse pharmacological functions such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-fibrotic, tumour-suppressive etc. The membrane-bound form plays a pivotal role in maintaining kidney homeostasis by regulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23) signalling, vitamin D metabolism and phosphate balance. Klotho deficiency has been linked with significantly reduced protection against various kidney pathological phenotypes, including diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is a major cause of chronic kidney disease leading to end-stage kidney disease. Owing to the pleiotropic actions of klotho, it has shown beneficial effects in DKD by tackling the complex pathophysiology and reducing kidney inflammation, oxidative stress, as well as fibrosis. Moreover, the protective effect of klotho extends beyond DKD in other pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, alzheimer's disease, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver disease. Therefore, this review summarizes the relationship between Klotho expression and various diseases with a special emphasis on DKD, the distinct mechanisms and the potential of exogenous Klotho supplementation as a therapeutic strategy. Future research into exogenous Klotho could unravel novel treatment avenues for DKD and other diseases.

In addition to global transmission of clade II monkeypox virus (MPXV), the recent spread of clade I has caused a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The third-generation smallpox vaccine modified vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) was recommended for at-risk populations in 2022, despite a scarcity of data on safety and effectiveness against mpox. METHODS: We did a prospective, multicentre, observational study, enrolling men who have sex with men and transgender people aged 18 years or older with changing sexual partners in Germany (Safety and Effectiveness of MVA-BN Vaccination Against MPXV Infection [SEMVAc]) between July 7, 2022, and Dec 31, 2023, evaluating safety and reactogenicity of one and two doses of subcutaneous MVA-BN. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated using risk ratios from the Kaplan-Meier estimator in an emulated retrospective target trial (Emulated Target Trial for Effectiveness of MVA-BN Vaccination Against mpox Infection in At-risk Individuals [TEMVAc]) from 3027 vaccinated individuals matched (1:1) to 3027 unvaccinated controls. SEMVAc and TEMVAc were registered in the HMA-EMA Catalogue, EUPAS50093, and the German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00029638, and are complete. FINDINGS: 6459 individuals were prospectively enrolled in SEMVAc. Adverse reactions were infrequent (first dose: 0·35% [95% CI 0·20-0·60] and second dose: 0·14% [0·06-0·33]). Local reactions were more frequent after the first dose (70·2% [95% CI 68·5-71·8]) compared with the second dose (56·8% [54·6-59]), as were systemic reactions (first dose, 22·3% [95% CI 20·9-23·9]; second dose, 17·6% [15·9-19·4]). In TEMVAc, 16 mpox cases were reported in vaccinated individuals versus 32 cases in matched unvaccinated individuals (median follow-up 55 days [IQR 23-89]). Effectiveness by 14 days or later after one dose was 57·8% (95% CI 11·8 to 83·0) overall, 84·1% (42·0 to 100) in people without HIV, but 34·9% (-72·8 to 79·0) in people living with HIV. Breakthrough infections were associated with reduced symptoms, compared with infections in unvaccinated individuals. INTERPRETATION: MVA-BN vaccination was safe and well tolerated. One dose of MVA-BN offered protection against mpox but effectiveness was reduced in people living with HIV. Although randomised controlled trials remain the preferred approach for assessing vaccine efficacy, combining prospective and retrospective study designs can be valuable during dynamic public health emergencies.

10.1186/s12943-025-02295-w	Lactate accumulation induces H4K12la to activate super-enhancer-driven RAD23A expression and promote niraparib resistance in ovarian cancer.	Lu B, Chen S, Guan X, Chen X, Du Y, Yuan J, Wang J, Wu Q, Zhou L, Huang X, Zhao Y	Ovarian cancer is a gynecological malignancy with the highest recurrence and mortality rates. Although niraparib can effectively affect its progression, the challenge of drug resistance remains. Herein, niraparib-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines were constructed to identify the abnormally activated enhancers and associated target genes via RNA in situ conformation sequencing. Notably, the target gene RAD23A was markedly upregulated in niraparib-resistant cells, and inhibiting RAD23A restored their sensitivity. Additionally, abnormal activation of glycolysis in niraparib-resistant cells induced lactate accumulation, which promoted the lactylation of histone H4K12 lysine residues. Correlation analysis showed that key glycolysis enzymes such as pyruvate kinase M and lactate dehydrogenase A were significantly positively correlated with RAD23A expression in ovarian cancer. Additionally, H4K12la activated the super-enhancer (SE) of niraparib and RAD23A expression via MYC transcription factor, thereby enhancing the DNA damage repair ability and promoting the drug resistance of ovarian cancer cells. Overall, the findings of this study indicate that lactic acid accumulation leads to lactylation of histone H4K12la, thereby upregulating SE-mediated abnormal RAD23A expression and promoting niraparib resistance in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting RAD23A as a potential therapeutic target for niraparib-resistant ovarian cancer.

10.1126/sciadv.ads5458	SIP2 is the master transcription factor of Plasmodium merozoite formation.	Nishi T, Kaneko I, Yuda M	Malaria, one of the most serious infectious diseases worldwide, is caused by the proliferation of Plasmodium parasites through repeated cycles of intraerythrocytic development. The parasite replicates via schizogony in host erythrocytes, producing multiple progeny merozoites that invade new erythrocytes. Although merozoite formation is the most crucial step in malaria pathogenesis, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. SIP2 is an AP2 transcription factor expressed during schizogony and is particularly conserved among erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites. Here, we reveal that SIP2 in Plasmodium berghei (PbSIP2) functions as the master transcription factor for merozoite formation. Conditional disruption of pbsip2 resulted in developmental arrest before merozoite formation and notable down-regulation of merozoite-related genes. ChIP-seq showed that PbSIP2 comprehensively activated merozoite-related genes by binding to previously reported cis-regulatory elements of merozoite invasion-related genes, including the bipartite motif (TGCAN(4-6)GTGCA). Collectively, our results indicate that SIP2 is a transcription factor that establishes erythrocyte infectivity and may have an evolutionary origin from the common ancestor of erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites.

Malaria, one of the most serious infectious diseases worldwide, is caused by the proliferation of Plasmodium parasites through repeated cycles of intraerythrocytic development. The parasite replicates via schizogony in host erythrocytes, producing multiple progeny merozoites that invade new erythrocytes. Although merozoite formation is the most crucial step in malaria pathogenesis, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. SIP2 is an AP2 transcription factor expressed during schizogony and is particularly conserved among erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites. Here, we reveal that SIP2 in Plasmodium berghei (PbSIP2) functions as the master transcription factor for merozoite formation. Conditional disruption of pbsip2 resulted in developmental arrest before merozoite formation and notable down-regulation of merozoite-related genes. ChIP-seq showed that PbSIP2 comprehensively activated merozoite-related genes by binding to previously reported cis-regulatory elements of merozoite invasion-related genes, including the bipartite motif (TGCAN(4-6)GTGCA). Collectively, our results indicate that SIP2 is a transcription factor that establishes erythrocyte infectivity and may have an evolutionary origin from the common ancestor of erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites.

10.1111/1759-7714.70039	Next-Generation Sequencing vs.	Wang Z, Yuan X, Nie Y, Wang J, Jiang G, Chen K	Accurately distinguishing between multiple primary lung cancers (MPLC) and intrapulmonary metastasis (IPM) is crucial for tailoring treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. While molecular methods offer significant advantages over traditional clinical-pathological evaluations, they lack standardized diagnostic protocols and validated prognostic value. This study systematically compared the diagnostic and prognostic performance of molecular methods versus clinical-pathological evaluations in diagnosing multiple lung cancers (MLCs), specifically focusing on the impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) parameters on diagnostic accuracy. A review of 41 studies encompassing 1266 patients revealed that two molecular methods, Mole1 (manually counting shared mutations) and Mole2 (bioinformatics-assisted clonal probability calculation), both demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy and prognostic discrimination capabilities. Molecular assessment, particularly Mole1, effectively stratified prognosis for MPLC and IPM, leading to significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS: HR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.15-0.39) and overall survival (OS: HR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.18-0.58). Further analysis suggests that a minimal panel of 30-50 genes may be sufficient to effectively differentiate prognoses. Compared to Mole1, Mole2 demonstrated greater specificity and stability across various panels, achieving AUC values from 0.962 to 0.979. Clinical-pathological evaluations proved unreliable, not only failing to distinguish prognosis effectively but also exhibiting a potential misdiagnosis rate of 35.5% and 33.6% compared to the reference diagnosis. To improve both cost-effectiveness and diagnostic accuracy, bioinformatics-assisted molecular diagnostics should be integrated into multidisciplinary assessments, especially for high-risk cases where diagnostic errors are common.

10.1007/s11883-025-01290-2	Managing Dyslipidemia in Chronic Kidney Disease: Implications for Cardiovascular and Renal Risk.	Theofilis P, Vlachakis PK, Karakasis P, Kalaitzidis RG	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review aims to address the complex relationship between dyslipidemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD), emphasizing its dual role in driving cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and contributing to CKD progression. It explores pathophysiological mechanisms, highlights recent biomarker discoveries, and evaluates contemporary and emerging lipid-lowering therapies tailored for CKD patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have highlighted the inadequacy of traditional lipid markers like LDL-C in reflecting cardiovascular risk in CKD. Novel biomarkers, such as remnant cholesterol and lipoprotein(a), demonstrate stronger associations with adverse outcomes. Emerging lipid-lowering agents, including bempedoic acid, pemafibrate, and PCSK9 inhibitors, show promise for risk reduction, especially in non-dialysis-dependent CKD. However, evidence remains limited for advanced stages of CKD and dialysis patients. Furthermore, alterations in lipid metabolism, such as dysfunctional HDL and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, are now recognized as significant contributors to CVD and renal damage in CKD populations. Dyslipidemia is a pivotal modifiable risk factor in CKD, exacerbating both cardiovascular risk and disease progression. While statins remain the cornerstone of therapy in early-to-moderate CKD, their efficacy diminishes in advanced stages. The advent of novel therapeutic options and a deeper understanding of dyslipidemia's pathophysiology hold potential for improving outcomes. Future research should prioritize personalized approaches, focusing on the unique metabolic derangements of CKD and advancing treatments for high-risk and dialysis-dependent patients.

Here, we demonstrate that CD4(+) but not CD8(+) anti-TGF-β CAR T cells (T28zT2 T cells) can suppress tumor growth partly through secreting Granzyme B and interferon (IFN)-γ. TGF-β1-treated CD4(+) T28zT2 T cells persist well in peripheral blood and tumors, maintain their mitochondrial form and function, and do not cause in vivo toxicity. They also improve the expansion and persistence of untransduced CD8(+) T cells in vivo. Tumor-infiltrating CD4(+) T28zT2 T cells are enriched with TCF-1(+)IL7R(+) memory-like T cells, express NKG2D, and downregulate T cell exhaustion markers, including PD-1 and LAG3. Importantly, a combination of CD4(+) T28zT2 T cells and CD8(+) anti-glypican-3 (GPC3) or anti-mesothelin (MSLN) CAR T cells exhibits augmented antitumor effects in xenografts. These findings suggest that rewiring TGF-β signaling with T28zT2 in CD4(+) T cells is a promising strategy for eradicating solid tumors.	Cell reports.

10.3389/fimmu.2025.1539074	Exposing the cellular situation: findings from single cell RNA sequencing in breast cancer.	Ni G, Li X, Nie W, Zhao Z, Li H, Zang H	BACKGROUND: Breast Cancer (BC) ranks among the top three most prevalent cancers globally and stands as the principal contributor to cancer-related fatalities among women. In spite of the substantial occurrence rate of BC, the early stage of this disease is generally regarded as curable. However, intra-tumor heterogeneity presents a formidable obstacle to the success of effective treatment. METHOD: In this research, single cell RNA sequencing was utilized to dissect the tumor microenvironment within BC. Slingshot, CytoTRACE and Monocle 2 were applied to illustrate the differentiation process of each subpopulation in the pseudotime sequence. To comprehensively comprehend the tumor cells (TCs) in BC, an analysis of upstream transcription factors was carried out via pySCENIC, while downstream pathway enrichment was conducted through KEGG, GO and GSEA. The prognosis model was established based on the bulk data obtained from TCGA and GEO databases. Knock-down experiments were also implemented to explore the function of the transcription factor CEBPD in the TCs. RESULTS: Our in-depth analysis identified eight principal cell types. Notably, TCs were predominantly found within epithelial cells. The classification of TCs further uncovered five unique subpopulations, with one subpopulation characterized by high UGDH expression. This subpopulation was shown to possess distinct metabolic features in metabolism-related investigations. The intricate communication modalities among different cell types were effectively demonstrated by means of CellChat. Additionally, a crucial transcription factor, CEBPD, was identified, which demonstrated a pronounced propensity towards tumors and harbored potential tumor-advancing characteristics. Its role in promoting cancer was subsequently verified through in vitro knock-down experiments. Moreover, a prognostic model was also developed, and a risk score was established based on the genes incorporated in the model. Through comparing the prognoses of different UTRS levels, it was determined that the group with a high UTRS had a less favorable prognosis. CONCLUSION: These outcomes contributed to the elucidation of the complex interrelationships within the BC tumor microenvironment. By specifically targeting certain subpopulations of TCs, novel treatment strategies could potentially be devised. This study shed light on the direction that future research in BC should take, furnishing valuable information that can be utilized to enhance treatment regimens.

This process establishes a hypoxic microenvironment that drives metabolic shifts and epigenetic modifications essential for cartilage development. To replicate this, we engineer a cell-adaptable supramolecular hydrogel that accommodates the extensive volumetric and morphological changes of encapsulated mesenchymal stromal cells, facilitating the rapid formation of large multicellular cartilaginous organoids. This adaptation fosters a hypoxic environment and induces metabolic shifts toward glycolysis, increasing lactate accumulation and histone lysine lactylation. Enhanced lactylation on Lysine 18 of Histone H3 promotes chondrogenesis and cartilage matrix deposition by improving the accessibility of chondrogenic genes, while the inhibition of histone lactylation disrupts these processes. Implantation of the ultradynamic hydrogel in large animal cartilage defects results in superior repair compared to less dynamic alternatives, providing insights for effective biomaterial delivery in cell therapies. Our findings reveal how matrix biophysical cues influence cellular development, metabolic reprogramming, and epigenetic modifications.

METHODS: We randomly assigned adults with physician-diagnosed, symptomatic, severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps to receive standard care and either tezepelumab (at a dose of 210 mg) or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. The coprimary end points were the changes from baseline in the total nasal-polyp score (range, 0 to 4 [for each nostril]; higher scores indicate greater severity) and the mean nasal-congestion score (range, 0 to 3; higher scores indicate greater severity) at week 52. Key secondary end points assessed in the overall population were the loss-of-smell score, the total score on the Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22; range, 0 to 110; higher scores indicate greater severity), the Lund-Mackay score (range, 0 to 24; higher scores indicate greater severity), the total symptom score (range, 0 to 24; higher scores indicate greater severity), and the first decision to treat with nasal-polyp surgery or use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy, or both, assessed in time-to-event analyses (individual and composite). RESULTS: In total, 203 patients were assigned to receive tezepelumab and 205 to receive placebo. At week 52, the patients who received tezepelumab had significant improvements in the total nasal-polyp score (mean difference vs. placebo, -2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.39 to -1.74) and the mean nasal-congestion score (-1.03; 95% CI, -1.20 to -0.86) (P<0.001 for both scores). Tezepelumab significantly improved the loss-of-smell score (mean difference vs. placebo, -1.00; 95% CI, -1.18 to -0.83), SNOT-22 total score (-27.26; 95% CI, -32.32 to -22.21), Lund-Mackay score (-5.72; 95% CI, -6.39 to -5.06), and total symptom score (-6.89; 95% CI, -8.02 to -5.76) (P<0.001 for all scores). Surgery for nasal polyps was indicated in significantly fewer patients in the tezepelumab group (0.5%) than in the placebo group (22.1%) (hazard ratio, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.09); there was significantly less use of systemic glucocorticoids with tezepelumab (5.2%) than with placebo (18.3%) (hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.27) (P<0.001 for both time-to-event analyses). CONCLUSIONS: Tezepelumab therapy led to significantly greater reductions in the size of nasal polyps, the severity of nasal congestion and sinonasal symptoms, and the use of nasal-polyp surgery and systemic glucocorticoids than placebo in adults with severe, uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

10.1186/s12957-025-03733-1	Global burden of prostate cancer: age-period-cohort analysis from 1990 to 2021 and projections until 2040.	Chu F, Chen L, Guan Q, Chen Z, Ji Q, Ma Y, Ji J, Sun M, Huang T, Song H, Zhou H, Lin X, Zheng Y	BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer among men worldwide. This study uses data from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study to estimate the global burden of prostate cancer from 1990 to 2021. METHODS: We analyzed the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of prostate cancer globally from 1990 to 2021. Based on the Sociodemographic Index (SDI), we used the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) and Age-Period-Cohort model to compare the burden of disease across different age groups and regions with varying levels of development. Finally, we used the Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort model to predict the trend of changes in the disease burden of prostate cancer by 2040. RESULTS: In 2021, the global age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of prostate cancer was 15.37 per 100,000, an increase from 13.69 per 100,000 in 1990. However, the age-standardized mortality rate (5.26 per 100,000) and DALY rate (95.94 per 100,000) decreased significantly compared to 1990. The burden of prostate cancer increased with age, but overall, the burden across all age groups was lower in 2021 than in 1990. The only exception was the incidence rate among individuals under 75 in 2021. High-income regions such as North America and Australia exhibited the highest burden in terms of ASIR, though there has been some reduction in recent years. Conversely, the burden of mortality and DALYs was highest in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, West Africa, and the Caribbean, where rates have continued to rise. Correlation analysis between SDI and the EAPC of the disease burden showed a negative correlation between EAPC of prostate cancer mortality and DALYs with SDI. The APC analysis showed that in 2021, the ASIR of prostate cancer in high SDI regions was still significantly higher across all age groups compared to other regions. In regions with middle SDI and above, the age-standardized mortality rate and DALY rate decreased over time or across birth cohorts, with a faster decline in areas with higher SDI. By 2040, it is projected that the global ASIR of prostate cancer will reverse its current trend and increase, while the age-standardized mortality rate and DALY rate will continue to decline, and the counts of incidence, mortality, and DALYs will keep rising. CONCLUSION: Although the global mortality rate and DALY rate for prostate cancer show a decreasing trend, the number of new cases, deaths, and DALYs continues to rise due to global population growth and the aging population, and the disease burden remains significant. Furthermore, there are substantial geographic disparities in the disease burden of prostate cancer. Therefore, targeted programs should be implemented to strengthen prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment in these specific regions.

Here, we report the 5-year outcomes. METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to cemiplimab 350 mg intravenous every 3 weeks for 2 years or investigator's choice of chemotherapy. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 712 patients were randomized to cemiplimab (n = 357) or chemotherapy (n = 355). Median duration of follow-up was 59.6 months (interquartile range: 55.1-66.7 months) at the data cutoff (January 16, 2024). In patients with verified PD-L1 ≥50% (n = 565), median OS was 26.1 months for cemiplimab vs. 13.3 months for chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48-0.72); median PFS was 8.1 months versus 5.3 months (HR 0.50, 95% CI: 0.41-0.61); the objective response rate was 46.5% versus 20.6%. The 5-year OS probability was 29.0% for cemiplimab and 15.0% for chemotherapy. Improved survival outcomes were observed with both squamous and non-squamous histology, and increasing activity of cemiplimab was correlated with higher PD-L1 expression, with the highest PD-L1 expression having the best outcome. The safety profile remains consistent with previous results. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 18.3% of patients for cemiplimab and 39.9% for chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: At 5-year follow-up, first-line cemiplimab monotherapy continued to show durable clinical benefits versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 ≥50%. Patients with PD-L1 ≥90% derived the largest clinical benefits.

10.3389/fphys.2018.00953	RNA Therapeutics in Cardiovascular Precision Medicine.	Laina A, Gatsiou A, Georgiopoulos G, Stamatelopoulos K, Stellos K	Since our knowledge on structure and function of messenger RNA (mRNA) has expanded from merely being an intermediate molecule between DNA and proteins to the notion that RNA is a dynamic gene regulator that can be modified and edited, RNA has become a focus of interest into developing novel therapeutic schemes. Therapeutic modulation of RNA molecules by DNA- and RNA-based therapies has broadened the scope of therapeutic targets in infectious diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and most recently in cardiovascular diseases as well. Currently, antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and microRNAs are the most widely applied therapeutic strategies to target RNA molecules and regulate gene expression and protein production. However, a number of barriers have to be overcome including instability, inadequate binding affinity and delivery to the tissues, immunogenicity, and off-target toxicity in order for these agents to evolve into efficient drugs. As cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, a large number of clinical trials are under development investigating the safety and efficacy of RNA therapeutics in clinical conditions such as familial hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, cardiac amyloidosis, and atrial fibrillation. In this review, we summarize the clinical trials of RNA-targeting therapies in cardiovascular disease and critically discuss the advances, the outcomes, the limitations and the future directions of RNA therapeutics in precision transcriptomic medicine.

Distler O, Vonk MC, Azuma A, Mayes MD, Khanna D, Highland KB, Toenges G, Alves M, Allanore Y	We used data from the SENSCIS and SENSCIS-ON trials to assess decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) who received long-term treatment with nintedanib and the effect of switching patients from placebo to nintedanib. In the SENSCIS trial, patients were randomised to receive nintedanib or placebo until the last patient reached week 52 but for ≤ 100 weeks. In SENSCIS-ON, the extension to SENSCIS, all patients received open-label nintedanib. Per protocol, the off-treatment period between these trials was ≤ 12 weeks. We assessed the trajectory of FVC in patients who received nintedanib in SENSCIS and continued nintedanib in SENSCIS-ON (n = 197) and in patients who received placebo in SENSCIS and initiated nintedanib in SENSCIS-ON (n = 231). The last on-treatment measurement in SENSCIS and the baseline measurement of SENSCIS-ON were considered anchor measurements. In patients who received nintedanib in SENSCIS, the mean decline in FVC in the 52 weeks prior to the last on-treatment measurement in SENSCIS was - 41.5 mL and the mean decline in FVC from baseline to week 52 of SENSCIS-ON was - 58.3 mL. In patients who received placebo in SENSCIS, the mean decline in FVC in the 52 weeks prior to the last on-treatment measurement in SENSCIS was - 96.8 mL and the mean decline in FVC from baseline to week 52 of SENSCIS-ON (when patients received nintedanib) was - 42.8 mL. These findings illustrate the progressive nature of SSc-ILD and support the efficacy of nintedanib in slowing decline in lung function over the long term.

Xu J, Xiong J, Jiang X, Sun M, Chen M, Luo X	This study investigated the connection between asthma in US individuals and their body roundness index (BRI) and weight-adjusted waist index (WWI). According to data from the 2005-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 3609 of the 25,578 persons in the survey who were 18 years of age or older reported having asthma. After adjusting for all confounders, the probability of asthma prevalence increased by 8% for every unit rise in BRI (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.06,1.11). The probability of asthma prevalence increased by 16% for every unit rise in WWI (OR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.08,1.25). The BRI and WWI indices were associated with prevalence and were nonlinearly correlated. The inflection points for threshold saturation effects were 4.36 and 10.69, respectively (log-likelihood ratio test, P < 0.05). Relationship subgroup analyses showed that the positive associations between BRI and WWI and asthma were generalized across populations and there was no significant interaction in most subgroups. In addition, sensitivity analyses verified the robustness of these results, further confirming the conclusion of BRI and WWI as independent risk factors for asthma. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that BRI outperformed WWI in predicting asthma, suggesting the potential of BRI in early asthma screening. Overall, BRI and WWI are independent risk factors for asthma with important clinical applications.

Overall, BRI and WWI are independent risk factors for asthma with important clinical applications.	association body roundness index weight adjust waist index asthma prevalence us adult nhanes cross sectional study 2005 2018 study investigate connection asthma us individual body roundness index bri weight adjust waist index wwi accord datum 2005 2018 national health nutrition examination survey nhanes 3609 25,578 person survey be 18 year age old report have asthma adjust confounder probability asthma prevalence increase 8 unit rise bri = 1.08 95 ci 1.06,1.11 probability asthma prevalence increase 16 unit rise wwi = 1.16 95 ci 1.08,1.25 bri wwi index be associate prevalence be nonlinearly correlate inflection point threshold saturation effect be 4.36 10.69 respectively log likelihood ratio test p < 0.05 relationship subgroup analysis show positive association bri wwi asthma be generalize population be significant interaction most subgroup addition sensitivity analysis verify robustness result far confirm conclusion bri wwi independent risk factor asthma finally receiver operate characteristic roc analysis show bri outperform wwi predict asthma suggest potential bri early asthma screening overall bri wwi be independent risk factor asthma important clinical application
10.1016/S1474-4422(25)00006-7	Multiple sclerosis and COVID-19: interactions and unresolved issues.	Zabalza A, Thompson A, Rotstein DL, Bar-Or A, Montalban X	Serious symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 complications are particular concerns for people with multiple sclerosis, especially those receiving immunosuppressants or immunomodulators. Studies have aimed to identify individuals with multiple sclerosis who are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, to analyse the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and multiple sclerosis and to evaluate immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccines. The emergence of evolving dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants, a range of available vaccines, and novel therapeutic approaches requires that clinical neurologists be regularly updated with the latest information. Unresolved issues include optimisation of vaccination strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy and the management of patients who do not show seroconversion post vaccination. Tailored vaccination has the potential to improve patient care, and future studies should focus on evaluating novel therapies and preventive measures while constantly updating our knowledge of potential SARS-CoV-2 variants, in preparation for future outbreaks or pandemics.

However, the distinct symptom trajectories and psychological burden in patients with post-COVID-19 DGBIs compared with patients with pre-existing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)/functional dyspepsia (FD) and non-DGBI controls remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: To examine the long-term gastrointestinal symptom progression and psychological comorbidities in patients with post-COVID-19 DGBI, patients with pre-existing IBS/FD and non-DGBI controls. METHODS: This post hoc analysis of a prospective multicenter cohort study reviewed patient charts for demographic data and medical history. Participants completed the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale at four time points: baseline, 1, 6, and 12 months, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 6 and 12 months. The cohort was divided into three groups: (1) post-COVID-19 DGBIs (2) non-DGBI, and (3) pre-existing IBS/FD, with the post-COVID-19 DGBIs group compared to the latter two control groups. RESULTS: Among 599 eligible patients, 27 (4.5%) were identified as post-COVID-19 DGBI. This group experienced worsening abdominal pain, hunger pain, heartburn, and acid regurgitation, unlike symptom improvement or stability in non-DGBI controls (p < 0.001 for all symptoms, except hunger pain, p = 0.001). While patients with pre-existing IBS/FD improved in most gastrointestinal symptoms but worsened in constipation and incomplete evacuation, patients with post-COVID-19 DGBI exhibited consistent symptom deterioration across multiple gastrointestinal domains. Anxiety and depression remained unchanged in patients with post-COVID-19 DGBI, contrasting with significant reductions in controls (non-DGBI: p = 0.003 and p = 0.057; pre-existing IBS/FD: p = 0.019 and p = 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection is associated with the development of newly diagnosed DGBIs and distinct symptom trajectories when compared with patients with pre-existing IBS/FD. Patients with post-COVID-19 DGBI experience progressive gastrointestinal symptom deterioration and persistent psychological distress, underscoring the need for tailored management strategies for this unique subgroup.

Here we describe a series of knock-in mice with a C57BL/6 background and with the conditional or constitutive expression of LbCas12a or of high-fidelity enhanced AsCas12a, which were inserted at the Rosa26 locus. The constitutive expression of Cas12a in the mice did not lead to discernible pathology and enabled efficient multiplexed genome engineering. We used the mice for the retrovirus-based immune-cell engineering of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, B cells and bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells, for autochthonous cancer modelling through the delivery of multiple CRISPR RNAs as a single array using adeno-associated viruses, and for the targeted genome editing of liver tissue using lipid nanoparticles. We also describe a system for simultaneous dual-gene activation and knockout (DAKO).

Teng F, Zhang R, Wang Y, Li Q, Wang B, Chen H, Liu T, Liu Z, Meng J, Dong S, Wang C, Li Y	The objective of this study is to develop predictive models for bladder cancer (BLCA) using tumor infiltrated immune cell (TIIC)-related genes. Multiple RNA expression data and scRNA-seq were downloaded from TCGA and GEO databases. We calculated tissue specificity index (TSI) and developed a computational framework to identify TIIC signature score based on 3 algorithms. Univariate Cox analysis was performed and TIIC-related model was generated by 20 machine learning algorithms. A significant correlation between TIIC signature score and survival status, tumor stage, and TNM staging system was found. Patients with BLCA in high-score group had more favorable survival outcomes and enhanced response to PD-L1 immunotherapy. Our TIIC model shows better performance in predicting prognosis of BLCA. Diverse frequencies of mutations were observed in human chromosomes across groups categorized by TIIC score. There was no statistically significant correlation observed between non-cancerous bladder conditions and bladder cancer when examining the SNPs associated with the genes in the prognostic model. However, a statistically significant association was found at the SNP sites of rs3763840. There was no significant association between bladder stone and bladder cancer, but there was a significant association on the SNP sites of rs3763840. In conclusion, we constructed a novel TIIC signature score for the prognosis and immunotherapy for BLCA, which offers direction for predicting the OS of patients with BLCA.

Yates TS, Fel J, Choi D, Trach JE, Behm L, Ellis CT, Turk-Browne NB	Humans lack memories for specific events from the first few years of life. We investigated the mechanistic basis of this infantile amnesia by scanning the brains of awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a subsequent memory task. Greater activity in the hippocampus during the viewing of previously unseen photographs was related to later memory-based looking behavior beginning around 1 year of age, suggesting that the capacity to encode individual memories comes online during infancy. The availability of encoding mechanisms for episodic memory during a period of human life that is later lost from our autobiographical record implies that postencoding mechanisms, whereby memories from infancy become inaccessible for retrieval, may be more responsible for infantile amnesia.

Szuba A, Cooke JP, Yousuf S, Rockson SG	PURPOSE: A prospective evaluation was undertaken to assess the efficacy of intensive, short-term decongestive lymphatic therapy coupled with focused patient instruction in long-term self-care for the management of lymphedema. METHODS: The therapeutic responses of 79 patients with lymphedema were analyzed prospectively. Each patient received intensive, short-term decongestive lymphatic therapy, with quantification of the extent and durability of the clinical response. Decongestive lymphatic therapy was performed by therapists trained in these techniques. The mean (+/-SD) duration of therapy was 8+/-3 days. Instruction in self-management techniques was incorporated into the therapeutic regimen by day 3 of the patient's treatment. The mean period of follow-up was 38+/-52 days. Changes in the volume of the affected limb were assessed with a geometric approximation derived from serial measurements of circumference along the axis of the limb. RESULTS: The mean short-term reduction in limb volume was 44%+/-62% of the excess volume in the upper extremities and 42%+/-40% in the lower extremities. At follow-up, these results were adequately sustained: mean long-term excess volume reductions of 38%+/-56% (upper extremities) and 41%+/-27% (lower extremities) were observed. CONCLUSION: Decongestive lymphatic therapy, combined with long-term self-management, is efficacious in treating patients with lymphedema of the extremity.

10.1038/s41398-025-03299-2	Multi-omics insight into the molecular networks of mental disorder related genetic pathways in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.	Zhang M, Zhao J, Ji H, Tan Y, Zhou S, Sun J, Ding Y, Li X	Mental disorders are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the genetic pathophysiology is not fully understood. We obtained data on mental disorder-related gene methylation, expression, protein levels, and summary statistics of IBD, and performed Summary data-based Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses to explore the causal associations and shared causal genetic variants between multiple molecular traits and IBD. Integrating multi-omics data, we found QDPR, DBI and MAX are associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) risk, while HP is linked to IBD risk. Inverse associations between gene methylation (cg0880851 and cg26689483) and expression are observed in QDPR, consistent with their detrimental role in UC. Methylation of DBI (cg11066750) protects against UC by enhancing expression. Higher levels of DBI (OR = 0.79, 95%CI = 0.69-0.90) and MAX (OR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.62-0.90) encoded proteins are inversely associated with UC risk, while higher QDPR (OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.07-1.28) and HP (OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 1.04-1.14) levels increase UC and IBD risk.

Although MASH is associated with enhanced neutrophil infiltration in the liver, the mediators and mechanisms underlying neutrophil-driven progression of MASH and fibrosis remain largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of neutrophil serine proteases neutrophil elastase (NE) and proteinase 3 (PR3) in the development of MASH and fibrosis. APPROACH: Liver biopsies from 121 morbidly obese patients were recruited for analysis. NE-/-, PR3-/-, microRNA-223 (miR-223)-/- mice and their wild type controls were fed a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet to induce MASH fibrosis. Bone marrow transplantation was performed to generate mice with miR-223 chimerism in bone marrow-derived cells. RESULTS: NE and PR3 content in human liver with MASH and fibrosis was markedly increased in close association with histological features. Genetic ablation or AAV-mediated inhibition of NE and PR3 substantially alleviated MASH and liver fibrosis in mice. Mechanistic study revealed that miR-223 suppressed neutrophilic NE and PR3 by targeting STAT3. MiR-223 deficiency augmented inflammation and fibrosis in mouse liver. Bone marrow transplantation-induced miR-223 chimerism significantly affected hepatic NE/PR3 content and the progression of MASH fibrosis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that NE and PR3 are key factors triggering liver inflammation to potentiate the development of MASH and liver fibrosis, offering insight into the development of new therapeutic approaches that target NE and PR3.

This study aimed to investigate the role of neutrophil serine proteases neutrophil elastase (NE) and proteinase 3 (PR3) in the development of MASH and fibrosis. APPROACH: Liver biopsies from 121 morbidly obese patients were recruited for analysis. NE-/-, PR3-/-, microRNA-223 (miR-223)-/- mice and their wild type controls were fed a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet to induce MASH fibrosis. Bone marrow transplantation was performed to generate mice with miR-223 chimerism in bone marrow-derived cells. RESULTS: NE and PR3 content in human liver with MASH and fibrosis was markedly increased in close association with histological features. Genetic ablation or AAV-mediated inhibition of NE and PR3 substantially alleviated MASH and liver fibrosis in mice. Mechanistic study revealed that miR-223 suppressed neutrophilic NE and PR3 by targeting STAT3. MiR-223 deficiency augmented inflammation and fibrosis in mouse liver. Bone marrow transplantation-induced miR-223 chimerism significantly affected hepatic NE/PR3 content and the progression of MASH fibrosis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that NE and PR3 are key factors triggering liver inflammation to potentiate the development of MASH and liver fibrosis, offering insight into the development of new therapeutic approaches that target NE and PR3.	neutrophil serine protease ne PR3 control mir-223 STAT3 axis potentiate mash liver fibrosis background aims metabolic dysfunction associate steatohepatitis mash related liver fibrosis represent substantial public health burden limited treatment option mash be associate enhanced neutrophil infiltration liver mediator mechanism underlie neutrophil drive progression mash fibrosis remain largely unknown study aim to investigate role neutrophil serine protease neutrophil elastase ne proteinase 3 PR3 development mash fibrosis approach liver biopsy 121 morbidly obese patient be recruit analysis ne-/- token0-/- microrna-223 mir-223)-/- mouse wild type control be feed choline deficient l amino acid define high fat diet to induce mash fibrosis bone marrow transplantation be perform to generate mouse mir-223 chimerism bone marrow derive cell result ne PR3 content human liver mash fibrosis be markedly increase close association histological feature genetic ablation aav mediate inhibition ne PR3 substantially alleviate mash liver fibrosis mouse mechanistic study reveal mir-223 suppress neutrophilic ne PR3 target STAT3 mir-223 deficiency augment inflammation fibrosis mouse liver bone marrow transplantation induce mir-223 chimerism significantly affect hepatic ne PR3 content progression mash fibrosis mouse conclusion finding reveal ne PR3 be key factor trigger liver inflammation to potentiate development mash liver fibrosis offer insight development new therapeutic approach target ne PR3
10.1016/B978-0-443-19104-6.00006-1	The glymphatic system.	Ghanizada H, Nedergaard M	The glymphatic system, a brain-wide network-supporting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF) exchange, is essential for removing metabolic waste from the brain. This system's proper functioning is crucial for maintaining neural health and preventing the accumulation of harmful substances that can lead to neurodegenerative diseases. This chapter explores the glymphatic system's mechanisms, its dysfunction in various neurologic disorders, and potential therapeutic strategies. Recent discoveries reveal the glymphatic system's involvement in aging, sleep, cerebral edema, and conditions, such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, small vessel disease, hydrocephalus, migraine, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and psychiatric disorders, where impaired waste clearance contributes to disease pathogenesis. Moreover, therapeutic interventions targeting glymphatic dysfunction present promising avenues for mitigating the effects of neurodegenerative diseases. The chapter underscores the potential of integrating glymphatic research into broader clinical practices, offering new strategies for disease management and prevention.

Here, we report an underappreciated role for γδ IELs in maintaining immunological tolerance during the onset and progression of CD-like ileitis using TNF(ΔARE/+) mice. We found that TNF-induced down-regulation of epithelial hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-gamma/butyrophilin is followed by a loss of ileal Vγ7 IELs and impaired barrier surveillance before the histological onset of disease. A reduction of immunoregulatory CD39(+) γδ IELs coincided with the influx of immature, peripheral CD39(neg) γδ T cells into the epithelium, leading to an expansion of induced IELs, whereas an earlier depletion of γδ IELs correlated with accelerated onset of ileal inflammation. Our findings identify multiple layers of γδ IEL dysregulation before ileitis development, indicating that the loss of steady-state immunoregulatory γδ IELs may contribute to the initiation of ileal CD.

Liu S, Popowski KD, Eckhardt CM, Zhang W, Li J, Jing Y, Silkstone D, Belcher E, Cislo M, Hu S, Lutz H, Ghodsi A, Liu M, Dinh PC, Cheng K	Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains an incurable form of interstitial lung disease with sub-optimal treatments that merely address adverse symptoms or slow fibrotic progression. Here, inhalable hsa-miR-30a-3p-loaded liposomes (miR-30a) for the treatment of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice are presented. It was previously found that exosomes (Exo) derived from lung spheroid cells are therapeutic in multiple animal models of pulmonary fibrosis and are highly enriched for hsa-miR-30a-3p. The present study investigates this miRNA as a singular factor to treat IPF. Liposomes containing miR-30a mimic can be delivered to rodents through dry powder inhalation. Inhaled miR-30a and Exo consistently lead to improved pulmonary function across six consecutive pulmonary function tests and promote de-differentiation of profibrotic myofibroblasts. The heterogenous composure of Exo also promotes reparative alveolar type I and II cell remodeling and vascular wound healing through broad transforming growth factor-beta signaling downregulation, while miR-30a targets myofibroblast de-differentiation through CNPY2/PERK/DDIT3 signaling. Overall, inhaled miR-30a represses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of myofibroblasts, providing fibrotic attenuation and subsequent improvements in pulmonary function.

10.3389/fendo.2025.1552772	Association between neutrophil-percentage-to-albumin ratio and diabetic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: a cross-sectional study from NHANES 2009-2018.	Li H, Xu Y, Fan S, Wang Z, Chen H, Zhang L, Lu Y, Miao Y	BACKGROUND: The neutrophil-percentage-to-albumin ratio (NPAR), as a low-cost and easily accessible inflammatory biomarker, has garnered considerable attention in various disease studies in recent years. Specifically, existing research has suggested a significant correlation between NPAR and diabetic retinopathy, indicating its potential relevance to diabetic complications. However, despite diabetic kidney disease (DKD) being a complication that severely affects the quality of life of diabetic patients, the association between the prevalence of DKD and NPAR remains to be elucidated. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential link between NPAR and DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We extracted complete data on neutrophil percentage, plasma albumin, serum creatinine, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database spanning from 2009 to 2018. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to examine the relationship between NPAR levels and DKD, and conducted sensitivity tests, subsequently employing Generalized Additive Models combined with smooth curve fitting methods to explore the relationships among variables. Then, subgroup analyses were conducted on the association between NPAR and DKD to investigate changes in the relationship across different subgroups. Finally, Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the predictive performance of the independent variable, NPAR, for the dependent variable, DKD. RESULTS: A total of 2,263 participants were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. After adjusting for confounding factors, the odds ratio for DKD was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.08-1.90) for the second quartile group, 1.75 (95% CI: 1.33-2.31) for the third quartile group, and 2.95 (95% CI: 2.22-3.93) for the fourth quartile group. Among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a positive correlation was observed between NPAR and DKD. Results from subgroup analyses showed no significant differences among different populations. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that NPAR had good predictive performance for DKD. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of DKD indicated a positive association with NPAR among individuals with T2DM. Additional large-scale prospective investigations may be helpful in corroborating these findings.

Zhao H, Gao X, Jiang Y, Yu Y, Wang L, Sun J, Wang M, Xiong X, Huang C, Zhang H, Jiang G	Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family aberrations are common in urothelial cancer. The FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erdafitinib has been approved for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer with FGFR2/3 alterations. Despite the initial efficacy of erdafitinib, resistance cannot be avoided. The molecular mechanisms underlying erdafitinib resistance have not been well investigated. Here, genome-wide CRISPR screen is performed and coatomer protein complex subunit α (COPA) is identified as a key target to enhance erdafitinib sensitivity. Functionally, the deficiency of COPA reduces the proliferation of FGFR-altered bladder cancer cells upon erdafitinib treatment. Mechanistically, COPA knockout increases the degradation of leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing (LRPPRC) protein, leading to reduced inhibitor of DNA binding 3 (ID3) mRNA stability in an m6A-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel mechanism of erdafitinib resistance, providing a potential therapeutic target for FGFR-altered bladder cancer.

Wu C, Mu Q, Gao W, Lu S	Anhedonia, as one of the core symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), has been regarded as a potential endophenotype of the disease. Multiple studies have evaluated the potential mechanisms of anhedonia in MDD, and found that MDD patients with anhedonia showed different functions in clinical features. In this review, we focus on the clinical research to explore the differences between MDD patients with and without anhedonia in the clinical manifestations and biological alterations, and elaborate the treatments and prognosis of anhedonia. It is demonstrated that anhedonia is associated with adverse outcomes including more severe depressive episode and suicidality, and poor prognosis in patients with MDD. At the biological level, MDD patients with anhedonia seem to present higher levels of inflammatory factors, abnormal metabolic function and hypermetabolism of BDNF. In brain imaging studies, there are some structural and/ or functional changes in multiple brain regions of subcortical and cortical areas, as well as the limbic system in MDD patients with anhedonia. Meanwhile, preliminary research findings have also indicated that there are associations between intestinal flora imbalance and anhedonia. Moreover, evidence indicated the benefit of some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors seemed limited on anhedonia, and other treatments including psychotherapy, physical therapy and probiotic interventions has remained to be explored but has interesting potential. Therefore, increased awareness of the anhedonic symptoms and the unique clinical features would benefit improved early diagnosis and therapeutic effects in MDD.

Wang Y, Zheng S, Guo R, Li Y, Yin H, Qiu X, Chen J, Ni C, Yuan Y, Gong Y	Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) antibiotic resistance poses a global health threat. Accurate identification of antibiotic resistant strains is essential for the control of infection. In the present study, our goal is to leverage the whole-genome data of H. pylori to develop practical and interpretable machine learning (ML) models for comprehensive antibiotic resistance assessment. A total of 296 H. pylori isolates with genome-wide data were downloaded from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases. By training ML models on feature sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms from SNP calling (SNPs-1), antibiotic-resistance SNP annotated by the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (SNPs-2), gene presence or absence (GPA), we generated predictive models for four antibiotics and multidrug-resistance (MDR). Among them, the models that combined SNPs-1, SNPs-2, and GPA data demonstrated the best performance, with the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) consistently outperforming others. And then we utilized the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the ML models. Furthermore, a free web application for the MDR model was deployed to the GitHub repository (https://H.pylori/MDR/App/). Our study demonstrated the promise of employing whole-genome data in conjunction with ML algorithms to forecast H. pylori antibiotic resistance. In the future, the application of this approach for predicting H. pylori antibiotic resistance would hold the potential to mitigate the empiric administration.

10.1016/j.jare.2025.03.037	From repellent to risk: DEET's adverse effects on hormones and bone health in kids.	Zhu X, Liu W, Lin B, Qian H, Xu M, Zheng Y, Bai Y	INTRODUCTION: Early life bone accumulation, which predicts future fragility fracture risk, is intimately associated with sex hormones. N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) is the primary and most effective active ingredient widely used globally, especially among children and adolescents. However, the effects of DEET on sex hormones and bone mass remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the adverse effects of DEET exposure on bone mass and to elucidate the potential mediating roles of sex hormones in children and adolescents. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed 864 children and adolescents from NHANES 2013-2016. Urinary 3-diethyl-carbamoyl benzoic acid (DCBA) was employed as a biomarker for DEET exposure. The study examined the relationships between DCBA, sex hormones, and bone mass, with a particular focus on evaluating the independent and serial mediation effects of sex hormones on DEET-bone mass associations. RESULTS: Increased DCBA was associated with decreased testosterone (TT), estrogen (E2), and free androgen index (FAI), alongside an increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, particularly pronounced among subjects < 12 years [β% (95 % CI) = -0.081 (-0.144, -0.017), -0.064 (-0.114, -0.013), -0.101 (-0.177, -0.024), and 0.020 (-0.009, 0.048), respectively] and non-overweight subjects [β% (95 % CI) = -0.160 (-0.234, -0.086), -0.103 (-0.158, -0.048), -0.195 (-0.282, -0.107), and 0.035 (0.012, 0.058), respectively]. Negative dose-response relationships between DCBA and bone mass were observed in non-overweight participants [β% (95 % CI) = -0.011 (-0.018, -0.005) and -0.027 (-0.041, -0.013) for total bone mineral density (BMD) and total bone mineral content (BMC), respectively], and in children < 12 years for total BMC [β% (95 % CI) = -0.012 (-0.024, 0.000)]. Additionally, TT, E2, and SHBG were found to significantly and independently mediate 15.41 % to 79.84 % of the relationship between DCBA and bone mass. Furthermore, serial mediation effects among sex hormones were detected between TT, E2, and SHBG. CONCLUSIONS: DEET exerts a detrimental effect on bone health by interfering with sex hormones in children and adolescents, warranting heightened public concern.	Journal of advanced research	21/03/2025	From repellent to risk: DEET's adverse effects on hormones and bone health in kids.. INTRODUCTION: Early life bone accumulation, which predicts future fragility fracture risk, is intimately associated with sex hormones. N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) is the primary and most effective active ingredient widely used globally, especially among children and adolescents. However, the effects of DEET on sex hormones and bone mass remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the adverse effects of DEET exposure on bone mass and to elucidate the potential mediating roles of sex hormones in children and adolescents. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed 864 children and adolescents from NHANES 2013-2016. Urinary 3-diethyl-carbamoyl benzoic acid (DCBA) was employed as a biomarker for DEET exposure. The study examined the relationships between DCBA, sex hormones, and bone mass, with a particular focus on evaluating the independent and serial mediation effects of sex hormones on DEET-bone mass associations. RESULTS: Increased DCBA was associated with decreased testosterone (TT), estrogen (E2), and free androgen index (FAI), alongside an increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, particularly pronounced among subjects < 12 years [β% (95 % CI) = -0.081 (-0.144, -0.017), -0.064 (-0.114, -0.013), -0.101 (-0.177, -0.024), and 0.020 (-0.009, 0.048), respectively] and non-overweight subjects [β% (95 % CI) = -0.160 (-0.234, -0.086), -0.103 (-0.158, -0.048), -0.195 (-0.282, -0.107), and 0.035 (0.012, 0.058), respectively]. Negative dose-response relationships between DCBA and bone mass were observed in non-overweight participants [β% (95 % CI) = -0.011 (-0.018, -0.005) and -0.027 (-0.041, -0.013) for total bone mineral density (BMD) and total bone mineral content (BMC), respectively], and in children < 12 years for total BMC [β% (95 % CI) = -0.012 (-0.024, 0.000)].

Ma Y, Liu S, Zhang F, Cong X, Zhao B, Sun M, Yang H, Liu M, Li P, Song Y, Cao J, Li Y, Zhang W, Liu K, Zhang J, Mi W	BACKGROUND: Perioperative stroke is a serious and potentially fatal complication following non-cardiac surgery. Thus, it is important to identify the risk factors and develop an effective prognostic model to predict the incidence of perioperative stroke following non-cardiac surgery. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We identified potential risk factors and built a model to predict the incidence of perioperative stroke using logistic regression derived from hospital registry data of adult patients that underwent non-cardiac surgery from 2008 to 2019 at The First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital. Our model was then validated using the records of two additional hospitals to demonstrate its clinical applicability. In our hospital cohorts, 223,415 patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery were included in this study with 525 (0.23%) patients experiencing a perioperative stroke. Thirty-three indicators including several intraoperative variables had been identified as potential risk factors. After multi-variate analysis and stepwise elimination (P < 0.05), 13 variables including age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, hypertension, previous stroke, valvular heart disease, preoperative steroid hormones, preoperative β-blockers, preoperative mean arterial pressure, preoperative fibrinogen to albumin ratio, preoperative fasting plasma glucose, emergency surgery, surgery type and surgery length were screened as independent risk factors and incorporated to construct the final prediction model. Areas under the curve were 0.893 (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.879, 0.908]; P < 0.001) and 0.878 (95% CI [0.848, 0.909]; P < 0.001) in the development and internal validation cohorts. In the external validation cohorts derived from two other independent hospitals, the areas under the curve were 0.897 and 0.895. In addition, our model outperformed currently available prediction tools in discriminative power and positive net benefits. To increase the accessibility of our predictive model to doctors and patients evaluating perioperative stroke, we published an online prognostic software platform, 301 Perioperative Stroke Risk Calculator (301PSRC). The main limitations of this study included that we excluded surgical patients with an operation duration of less than one hour and that the construction and external validation of our model were from three independent retrospective databases without validation from prospective databases and non-Chinese databases. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we identified 13 independent risk factors for perioperative stroke and constructed an effective prediction model with well-supported external validation in Chinese patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. The model may provide potential intervention targets and help to screen high-risk patients for perioperative stroke prevention.

Upon CLPB loss, MICU1 and MICU2, regulators of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (mtCU), and OPA1, a main mediator of mitochondrial fusion, become insoluble but the functional outcome remains unclear. In this work we demonstrate that CLPB is required to maintain mitochondrial calcium signalling and fusion dynamics. CLPB loss results in altered mtCU composition, interfering with mitochondrial calcium uptake independently of cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, OPA1 decreases, and aggregation occurs, accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation. Disease-associated mutations in the CLPB gene present in skin fibroblasts from patients also display mitochondrial calcium and structural changes. Thus, mtCU and fusion activity are dependent on CLPB, and their impairments might contribute to the disease caused by CLPB variants.

To investigate the interaction between tumor cells and stromal cells, we established GCB-DLBCL patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to isolate primary tumor cells and coculture them with stromal cells. Additionally, we presented GCB-DLBCL cases with histopathologic confirmation and analysed the online databases to explore the underlying mechanisms. We demonstrated that CD40 ligand (CD40L) expressed on stromal cells activated CD40 pathway in GCB-DLBCL tumor cells, protecting tumor cells from apoptosis and up-regulating RANK ligand (RANKL). And the RANKL expressed on tumor cells enhanced the expression of CD40L and BAFF in stromal cells, which in turn promoted tumor cells survival through activating NF-κB signaling. Significantly, the activation of CD40 pathway up-regulated KDM6B, a lysine-specific demethylase, and KDM6B further enhanced the transcription activity of NF-κB signaling, which has not been reported in B cells.

10.1186/s12933-025-02689-6	The prognostic significance of stress hyperglycemia ratio in evaluating all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk among individuals across stages 0-3 of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome: evidence from two cohort studies.	Tan MY, Zhang YJ, Zhu SX, Wu S, Zhang P, Gao M	BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association (AHA) proposed the concept of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, underscoring the interconnectedness of cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic diseases. The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) represents an innovative indicator that quantifies blood glucose fluctuations in patients experiencing acute or subacute stress, correlating with detrimental clinical effects. Nevertheless, the prognostic significance of SHR within individuals diagnosed with CKM syndrome in stages 0 to 3, particularly with respect to all-cause or cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risks, has not been fully understood yet. METHODS: The current study analyzed data from 9647 participants with CKM syndrome, covering stages 0 to 3, based on the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) collected from 2007 to 2018. In this study, the primary exposure variable was the SHR, computed as fasting plasma glucose divided by (1.59 * HbA1c - 2.59). The main endpoints of study were all-cause mortality as well as CVD mortality, with death registration data sourced through December 31, 2019. The CHARLS database (China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study) was utilized as validation to enhance the reliability of the findings. RESULTS: This study included 9647 NHANES participants, who were followed for a median duration of 6.80 years. During this period, 630 all-cause mortality cases and 135 CVD-related deaths in total were recorded. After full adjustment for covariates, our results displayed a robust positive association of SHR with all-cause mortality (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.09, 95% Confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.13). However, the SHR exhibited no significant relationship with CVD mortality (HR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.91-1.11). The mediation analysis results suggested that the relationship between SHR and all-cause mortality risk is partially mediated by RDW, albumin, and RAR. Specifically, the mediating effects were - 17.0% (95% CI - 46.7%, - 8.7%), - 10.1% (95% CI - 23.9%, - 4.7%), and - 23.3% (95% CI - 49.0%, - 13.0%), respectively. Additionally, analyses of the CHARLS database indicated a significant positive correlation between SHR and all-cause mortality among individuals diagnosed with CKM across stages 0-3 during the follow-up period from 2011 to 2020. CONCLUSIONS: An increased SHR value is positively associated with an elevated likelihood of all-cause mortality within individuals diagnosed with CKM syndrome across stages 0-3, yet it shows no significant association with CVD mortality. SHR is an important tool for predicting long-term adverse outcomes in this population. Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome emphasizes the interconnectedness of cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic diseases. The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is a novel marker reflecting stress-induced glucose fluctuations, but its prognostic value in individuals with CKM syndrome (stages 0-3) remains uncertain. This study explores the association between SHR and all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in this population. Our findings indicate that SHR is significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.13), but not with CVD mortality (HR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.91-1.11). Mediation analysis results suggested that the relationship between SHR and all-cause mortality risk is partially mediated by RDW, albumin, and RAR. Specifically, the mediating effects were - 17.0% (95% CI - 46.7%, - 8.7%), - 10.1% (95% CI - 23.9%, - 4.7%), and - 23.3% (95% CI - 49.0%, - 13.0%), respectively. Validation using the CHARLS database supports these findings. These results suggest that SHR could serve as a prognostic biomarker for long-term mortality risk in CKM patients, offering potential clinical utility in risk stratification and management.	Cardiovascular diabetology	24/03/2025	The prognostic significance of stress hyperglycemia ratio in evaluating all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk among individuals across stages 0-3 of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome: evidence from two cohort studies.. BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association (AHA) proposed the concept of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, underscoring the interconnectedness of cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic diseases. The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) represents an innovative indicator that quantifies blood glucose fluctuations in patients experiencing acute or subacute stress, correlating with detrimental clinical effects. Nevertheless, the prognostic significance of SHR within individuals diagnosed with CKM syndrome in stages 0 to 3, particularly with respect to all-cause or cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risks, has not been fully understood yet. METHODS: The current study analyzed data from 9647 participants with CKM syndrome, covering stages 0 to 3, based on the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) collected from 2007 to 2018. In this study, the primary exposure variable was the SHR, computed as fasting plasma glucose divided by (1.59 * HbA1c - 2.59). The main endpoints of study were all-cause mortality as well as CVD mortality, with death registration data sourced through December 31, 2019. The CHARLS database (China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study) was utilized as validation to enhance the reliability of the findings. RESULTS: This study included 9647 NHANES participants, who were followed for a median duration of 6.80 years. During this period, 630 all-cause mortality cases and 135 CVD-related deaths in total were recorded. After full adjustment for covariates, our results displayed a robust positive association of SHR with all-cause mortality (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.09, 95% Confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.13). However, the SHR exhibited no significant relationship with CVD mortality (HR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.91-1.11). The mediation analysis results suggested that the relationship between SHR and all-cause mortality risk is partially mediated by RDW, albumin, and RAR. Specifically, the mediating effects were - 17.0% (95% CI - 46.7%, - 8.7%), - 10.1% (95% CI - 23.9%, - 4.7%), and - 23.3% (95% CI - 49.0%, - 13.0%), respectively.

When Pi is scarce, modifications of root system architecture (RSA) enhance the soil exploration ability of the plant and lead to an increase in Pi uptake. In Arabidopsis, an iron-dependent mechanism reprograms primary root growth in response to low Pi availability. This program is activated upon contact of the root tip with low-Pi media and induces premature cell differentiation and the arrest of mitotic activity in the root apical meristem, resulting in a short-root phenotype. However, the mechanisms that regulate the primary root response to Pi-limiting conditions remain largely unknown. Here we report on the isolation and characterization of two low-Pi insensitive mutants (lpi5 and lpi6), which have a long-root phenotype when grown in low-Pi media. Cellular, genomic, and transcriptomic analysis of low-Pi insensitive mutants revealed that the genes previously shown to underlie Arabidopsis Al tolerance via root malate exudation, known as SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY (STOP1) and ALUMINUM ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER 1 (ALMT1), represent a critical checkpoint in the root developmental response to Pi starvation in Arabidopsis thaliana Our results also show that exogenous malate can rescue the long-root phenotype of lpi5 and lpi6 Malate exudation is required for the accumulation of Fe in the apoplast of meristematic cells, triggering the differentiation of meristematic cells in response to Pi deprivation.

The mechanisms by which the permeable monolayer of loosely connected lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)(4) maintains mechanical stability remain elusive. Here we identify dynamic cytoskeletal regulation of LEC shape, induced by isotropic stretch, as crucial for the integrity and function of dermal lymphatic capillaries. We found that the oak leaf-shaped LECs showed a spectrum of VE-cadherin-based junctional configurations at the lobular intercellular interface and a unique cytoskeletal organization, with microtubules at concave regions and F-actin at convex lobes. Multispectral and longitudinal intravital imaging of capillary LEC shape and actin revealed dynamic remodelling of cellular overlaps in vivo during homeostasis and in response to interstitial fluid volume increase. Akin to puzzle cells of the plant epidermis(5,6), LEC shape was controlled by Rho GTPase CDC42-regulated cytoskeletal dynamics, enhancing monolayer stability. Moreover, cyclic isotropic stretch increased cellular overlaps and junction curvature in primary LECs. Our findings indicate that capillary LEC shape results from continuous remodelling of cellular overlaps that maintain vessel integrity while preserving permeable cell-cell contacts compatible with vessel expansion and fluid uptake. We propose a bellows-like fluid propulsion mechanism, in which fluid-induced lumen expansion and shrinkage of LEC overlaps are countered by actin-based lamellipodia-like overlap extension to aid vessel constriction.

10.1242/jcs.061606	Pax3 induces differentiation of juvenile skeletal muscle stem cells without transcriptional upregulation of canonical myogenic regulatory factors.	Young AP, Wagers AJ	Pax3 is an essential myogenic regulator of fetal and embryonic development, but its role in postnatal myogenesis remains a topic of debate. We show that constitutive expression of Pax3 in postnatal, juvenile mouse skeletal muscle stem cells, a subset of the heterogeneous satellite cell pool highly enriched for myogenic activity, potently induces differentiation. This differentiation-promoting activity stands in contrast to the differentiation-inhibiting effects of Pax3 in the commonly used mouse myoblast cell line C2C12. Pax3 mRNA levels in distinct muscles correlate with the rate of myogenic differentiation of their muscle stem cells. Although Pax3 controls embryonic myogenesis through regulation of the canonical myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) Myf-5, MyoD, myogenin and Mrf4, we find that in postnatal muscle stem cells, ectopic Pax3 expression fails to induce expression of any of these factors. Unexpectedly, overexpression of neither Myf-5 nor myogenin is sufficient to induce differentiation of juvenile stem cells; and knockdown of Myf-5, rather than inhibiting differentiation, promotes it. Taken together, our results suggest that there are distinct myogenic regulatory pathways that control the embryonic development, juvenile myogenesis and adult regeneration of skeletal myofibers.

10.1016/j.jbc.2025.108413	The Structural Basis of Substrate Selectivity of the Acinetobactin Biosynthetic Adenylation Domain, BasE.	Ahmed SF, Gulick AM	Siderophores are small molecule natural products that are often produced by enzymes called non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) that many pathogenic bacteria produce to adapt to low iron conditions. NRPS bioengineering could lead to the production of siderophore analogs with the potential to interrupt this unique bacterial iron uptake system, endowing the molecules with antimicrobial properties. Acinetobacter baumannii produces the catecholate siderophore acinetobactin to scavenge iron, a nutrient essential for several metabolic processes. Previous studies have reported synthetic analogs of acinetobactin that disrupt iron acquisition by A. baumannii, resulting in inhibition of bacterial growth. To foster a long-term goal of using a chemoenzymatic approach to produce additional analogs, we have targeted the adenylation domain BasE for the incorporation of alternate substrates. Here we report a structure-guided approach to investigate the substrate selectivity of BasE for non-native aryl substrates. Using targeted mutagenesis in the active site of BasE, we generated mutants that catalyze the activation of alternate substrates with catalytic efficiencies comparable to the wildtype enzyme with its natural substrate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB). We further solved structures of these mutants bound to the non-native substrates that illustrate an expanded binding pocket that support the improved promiscuity of BasE. Motivated to develop an approach to produce analogs of acinetobactin, including molecules that could block iron uptake or be readily conjugated to antibiotic cargo, our work aims to develop a structure-guided approach for using catecholate siderophore pathways to incorporate alternate substrates.

Wang Z, Yuan M, Yao L, Xiong Z, Dai K, Liu P, Chen P, Sun M, Shu K, Xia Y, Jiang Y	Liver fibrosis is a leading cause of liver-related mortality worldwide, yet effective therapies remain limited. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently shown promise in treating liver fibrosis due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which MSCs exert their effects remain unclear. In this study, we explored how human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) contribute to treating liver fibrosis, and revealed a crucial role of ferroptosis in modulating hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activity. We found that MSCs primarily promote ferroptosis in HSCs in an exosome-dependent manner. Specifically, MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) deliver miR-499a-5p, which interacts with the transcription factor ETS1, leading to the suppression of GPX4, a key regulator of ferroptosis, thereby reducing the fibrogenic activity of HSCs. Overexpression of ETS1 in HSCs counteracted miR-499a-5p-induced ferroptosis, underscoring the pathway's potential as a target for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, molecular docking simulations further identified optimal ETS1-GPX4 binding sites. This research uncovers a novel mechanism by which MSCs may treat liver fibrosis, providing insights that could guide the development of more effective therapies for this widespread condition.

Ge S, Qiu B, Liu R, Sun L, Yang L, Chen X, Tao H, Yang W, Yu Y, Wang D	Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder requiring improved therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the potential of ultraviolet (UV)-treated riboflavin in AD treatment. Using a MC903-induced mouse model, we demonstrate that topical UV-treated riboflavin significantly attenuates AD progression. Mechanistically, UV-treated riboflavin suppresses macrophage nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation by reducing histone H3 lysine 9 lactylation (H3K9la) on NLRP3 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) promoter, decreasing interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion and subsequent keratinocyte-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) production. It also directly inhibits inflammatory cytokine expression in keratinocytes. NLRP3 activation in vivo partially reverses these effects, confirming the central role of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. Our findings reveal a novel epigenetic mechanism of UV-treated riboflavin in modulating immune responses in AD, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic strategy for inflammatory skin disorders.

Integrating genomic medicine into healthcare systems is a health policy challenge that requires continuously transferring scientific advances into clinics and ensuring equal access for patients. France was one of the first countries to integrate genome sequencing into clinical practice at a nationwide level, with the ambition to provide more accurate diagnostics and personalized treatments. Since 2016, the French government has invested €239M in the 2025 French Genomic Medicine Initiative (PFMG2025) which has so far focused on patients with rare diseases (RD), cancer genetic predisposition (CGP) and cancers. PFMG2025 has addressed numerous challenges to set up an operational organizational framework. As of December the 31st 2023, 12,737 results were returned to prescribers for RD/CGP patients (median delivery time: 202 days, diagnostic yield: 30.6%) and 3109 for cancer patients (median delivery time: 45 days). PFMG2025's future priorities encompass ensuring economic sustainability, strengthening links with research, empowering patients and practitioners, and fostering collaborations with European partners.

10.1021/acsnano.5c01498	Protein Carrier Adeno-Associated Virus.	Hoffmann MD, Sorensen RJ, Extross A, He Y, Schmidt D	Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a leading platform for gene therapy, enabling the delivery of therapeutic DNA to target cells. However, the potential of AAV to deliver protein payloads has been unexplored. In this study, we engineered a protein carrier AAV (pcAAV) to package and deliver proteins by inserting binding domains on the interior capsid surface. These binding domains mediate the packaging of specific target proteins through interaction with cognate peptides or protein tags during the capsid assembly process. We demonstrate the packaging of multiple proteins, including green fluorescent protein, Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, Cre recombinase, and the engineered peroxidase APEX2. Packaging efficiency is modulated by the binding domain insertion site, the viral protein isoform containing the binding domain, and the subcellular localization of the target protein. We show that pcAAV can enter cells and deliver the protein payload and that enzymes retain their activity after packaging. Importantly, this protein packaging capability can be translated to multiple AAV serotypes. Our work establishes AAV as a protein delivery vehicle, significantly expanding the utility of this viral vector for biomedical applications.

10.1038/s41398-025-03313-7	Suprachiasmatic nucleus dysfunction induces anxiety- and depression-like behaviors via activating the BDNF-TrkB pathway of the striatum.	Liang X, Ding Y, Zhu X, Qiu J, Shen X, Xiong Y, Zhou J, Liang X, Xie W	The circadian rhythm system consists of a master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and peripheral clocks dispersed throughout other brain areas (including striatum, Str) as well as various tissues and organs. Circadian rhythm disturbance is a major risk factor and common comorbidity for mood disorders, especially anxiety and depression. Bmal1 is one of the fundamental clock protein genes that is required to maintain circadian rhythm. Recent research has revealed a link between suprachiasmatic nucleus dysfunction and anxiety and depression, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate how circadian rhythm disturbance may lead to anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Through behavioral tests, virus tracing, molecular biology and other techniques, we found neural connection from the suprachiasmatic nucleus to the striatum. SCN lesions and Bmal1(flox/flox) + pAAV-hSyn-Cre-GFP (conditional knockout, cKO) mice exhibited disruptions in core body temperature rhythm, as well as anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Importantly, these mice displayed altered expression patterns of clock protein genes and an upregulation of the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) - Tyrosine Kinase receptor B (TrkB) signaling pathway within the striatum. Microinjection of the TrkB inhibitor ANA-12 can effectively reverse anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. These findings indicate that suprachiasmatic nucleus dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression through upregulation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway in the striatum, potentially mediated by neural projections from the SCN. Bmal1 gene within SCN may represent a novel therapeutic target for mood disorders.

10.1097/HEP.0000000000001313	Higher level of Hepatitis B Surface antigen associated with delayed development of hepatocellular carcinoma in immune-tolerant patients.	Tseng TC, Hosaka T, Pan MH, Liu CJ, Suzuki F, Chen CJ, Su TH, Kumada H, Yang WT, Yang HC, Liu CH, Chen PJ, Yang HI, Kao JH	BACKGROUND: Active viral replication in patients with chronic HBV infection is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the HCC risk in highly viremic patients, such as immune-tolerant patients, remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between viral factors and HCC risk in patients with chronic HBV infection, focusing on immune-tolerant patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 6,139 non-cirrhotic Taiwanese patients with chronic HBV infection were enrolled, comprising 2,666 patients from ERADICATE-B study and 3,473 patients from REVEAL-HBV study. The primary endpoint was HCC development. The relationships between viral factors and HCC risk in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Over a median 21.7-year follow-up, 547 patients developed HCC. The relationship between viral factors and HCC risk varied depending on HBeAg status. HCC risk increased with viral load and plateaued at ≥5 log10 IU/mL in HBeAg-negative patients, while showing limited correlation in HBeAg-positive patients. Conversely, HBsAg levels were positively associated with HCC risk in HBeAg-negative patients but negatively associated in HBeAg-positive patients. Further investigation focusing on HBeAg-positive immune-tolerant patients showed that HBsAg levels ≥10,000 IU/mL (vs. <10,000 IU/mL) were associated with delayed HCC development, which was validated both internally through various subgroup analyses and externally by an independent Japanese cohort. CONCLUSION: Predictive roles of HBV DNA and HBsAg levels in HCC development differ between HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive patients. Particularly, among immune-tolerant patients, HBsAg levels ≥10,000 IU/mL showed delayed development of HCC, suggesting HBsAg as a biomarker to define genuine immune-tolerant patients.

Bernardo-Colón A, Bighinati A, Parween S, Debnath S, Piano I, Adani E, Corsi F, Gargini C, Vergara N, Marigo V, Patricia Becerra S	BACKGROUND: Photoreceptor death leads to inherited blinding retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). As disease progression often outpaces therapeutic advances, developing effective treatments is urgent. This study evaluates the efficacy of small peptides derived from pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), which are known to restrict common cell death pathways associated with retinal diseases. METHODS: We tested chemically synthesized peptides (17-mer and H105A) with affinity for the PEDF receptor, PEDF-R, delivered as eye drops to two RP mouse models: rd10 (phosphodiesterase 6b mutation) and Rho(P23H/+) (rhodopsin P23H mutation). Additionally, we engineered AAV-H105A vectors for intravitreal delivery in Rho(P23H/+) mice. To assess peptide effects in human tissue, we used retinal organoids exposed to cigarette smoke extract, a model of oxidative stress. Photoreceptor survival, morphology and function were evaluated. RESULTS: Here we show that peptides 17-mer and H105A delivered via eye drops successfully reach the retina, promote photoreceptor survival, and improve retinal function in both RP mouse models. Intravitreal delivery of a AAV-H105A vector delays photoreceptor degeneration in Rho(P23H/+) mice up to six months. In human retinal organoids, peptide H105A specifically prevents photoreceptor death induced by oxidative stress, a contributing factor to RP progression. CONCLUSIONS: PEDF peptide-based eye drops offer a promising, minimally invasive therapy to prevent photoreceptor degeneration in retinal disorders, with a favorable safety profile.

While most SCLCs respond to frontline therapy, resistance inevitably develops. Identifying phenotypes potentiating chemoresistance and immune evasion is a crucial unmet need.

However, it is unknown if SCLCs exhibit distinct DDR phenotypes. METHODS: To study SCLC DDR phenotypes, we developed a new DDR gene analysis method and applied it to SCLC clinical samples, in vitro, and in vivo model systems. We then investigated how DDR regulation is associated with SCLC biology, chemotherapy response, and tumor evolution following therapy. RESULTS: Using multi-omic profiling, we demonstrate that SCLC tumors cluster into three DDR phenotypes with unique molecular features.

10.1002/mco2.70139	ATP11B Modulates Microglial Lipid Metabolism and Alleviates Alzheimer's Disease Pathology.	Zhang Y, Zhang S, Zhao X, Wu P, Ying Y, Wu L, Zhuang J, Chen Z, Chao Y, Dong X, Zhao RC, Wang J	Abnormal lipid metabolism in microglia leads to the formation of pathological lipid droplets (LDs), a phenomenon also observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The abnormal accumulation of LDs disrupts normal cellular function and exacerbates the pathological process of AD. ATP11B is a P4-ATPase and the expression of Atp11b changes in the brain of patients with AD and diseases of lipid metabolism. The present study aimed to explore the regulatory role of ATP11B in microglial lipid metabolism and assess the potential of ATP11B as a therapeutic target for AD. Atp11b deficiency caused excessive fatty acid uptake and activated the PPAR signaling pathway, resulting in abnormal synthesis of neutral lipids and mitochondrial energy metabolism in microglia. Further results showed that Atp11b deficiency led to the accumulation of pathological LDs in microglia and AD mice. Conversely, overexpression of Atp11b alleviated exploratory behavior impairment, learning and memory impairment, LD accumulation, beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, and inflammatory response in the brain of AD mice.

Abnormal lipid metabolism in microglia leads to the formation of pathological lipid droplets (LDs), a phenomenon also observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The abnormal accumulation of LDs disrupts normal cellular function and exacerbates the pathological process of AD. ATP11B is a P4-ATPase and the expression of Atp11b changes in the brain of patients with AD and diseases of lipid metabolism. The present study aimed to explore the regulatory role of ATP11B in microglial lipid metabolism and assess the potential of ATP11B as a therapeutic target for AD. Atp11b deficiency caused excessive fatty acid uptake and activated the PPAR signaling pathway, resulting in abnormal synthesis of neutral lipids and mitochondrial energy metabolism in microglia. Further results showed that Atp11b deficiency led to the accumulation of pathological LDs in microglia and AD mice. Conversely, overexpression of Atp11b alleviated exploratory behavior impairment, learning and memory impairment, LD accumulation, beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, and inflammatory response in the brain of AD mice. These findings provide important clues for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AD and for developing novel therapeutic strategies.

10.1038/s41467-025-58087-9	Structural basis for cholesterol sensing of LYCHOS and its interaction with indoxyl sulfate.	Wang Z, He J, Yang Y, He Y, Qian H	The lysosome serves as an essential nutrient-sensing hub within the cell, where the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is activated. Lysosomal cholesterol signaling (LYCHOS), a lysosome membrane protein, has been identified as a cholesterol sensor that couples cholesterol concentration to mTORC1 activation. However, the molecular basis is unknown. Here, we determine the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human LYCHOS at a resolution of 3.1 Å, revealing a cholesterol-like density at the interface between the permease and G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) domains. Advanced 3D classification reveals two distinct states of LYCHOS. Comparative structural analysis between these two states demonstrated a cholesterol-related movement of GPCR domain relative to permease domain, providing structural insights into how LYCHOS senses lysosomal cholesterol levels. Additionally, we identify indoxyl sulfate (IS) as a binding ligand to the permease domain, confirmed by the LYCHOS-IS complex structure. Overall, our study provides a foundation and indicates additional directions for further investigation of the essential role of LYCHOS in the mTORC1 signaling pathway.

Rorsman HO, Müller MA, Liu PZ, Sanchez LG, Kempf A, Gerbig S, Spengler B, Miesenböck G	Voltage-gated potassium (K(V)) channels contain cytoplasmically exposed β-subunits(1-5) whose aldo-keto reductase activity(6-8) is required for the homeostatic regulation of sleep(9). Here we show that Hyperkinetic, the β-subunit of the K(V)1 channel Shaker in Drosophila(7), forms a dynamic lipid peroxidation memory. Information is stored in the oxidation state of Hyperkinetic's nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) cofactor, which changes when lipid-derived carbonyls(10-13), such as 4-oxo-2-nonenal or an endogenous analogue generated by illuminating a membrane-bound photosensitizer(9,14), abstract an electron pair. NADP(+) remains locked in the active site of K(V)β until membrane depolarization permits its release and replacement with NADPH. Sleep-inducing neurons(15-17) use this voltage-gated oxidoreductase cycle to encode their recent lipid peroxidation history in the collective binary states of their K(V)β subunits; this biochemical memory influences-and is erased by-spike discharges driving sleep. The presence of a lipid peroxidation sensor at the core of homeostatic sleep control(16,17) suggests that sleep protects neuronal membranes against oxidative damage. Indeed, brain phospholipids are depleted of vulnerable polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains after enforced waking, and slowing the removal of their carbonylic breakdown products increases the demand for sleep.

Xiong J, Ma R, Xie K, Shan C, Chen H, Wang Y, Liao Y, Deng Y, Ye G, Wang Y, Zhu Q, Zhang Y, Cai H, Guo W, Yin Y, Li Z	Endochondral ossification generates most of the load-bearing bones, recapitulating it in human cells remains a challenge. Here, we report generation of SOX9(+) sclerotomal progenitors (scl-progenitors), a mesenchymal precursor at the pre-condensation stage, from human pluripotent stem cells and development of osteochondral induction methods for these cells. Upon lineage-specific induction, SOX9(+) scl-progenitors have not only generated articular cartilage but have also undergone spontaneous condensation, cartilaginous anlagen formation, chondrocyte hypertrophy, vascular invasion, and finally bone formation with stroma, thereby recapitulating key stages during endochondral ossification. Moreover, self-organized growth plate-like structures have also been induced using SOX9(+) scl-progenitor-derived fusion constructs with chondro- and osteo-spheroids, exhibiting molecular and cellular similarities to the primary growth plates. Furthermore, we have identified ITGA9 as a specific surface marker for reporter-independent isolation of SOX9(+) scl-progenitors and established a culture system to support their expansion.

10.1016/j.ymthe.2025.03.024	Genetically engineered macrophages reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and improve immunotherapeutic efficacy in TNBC.	Jiang R, Yang L, Liu X, Xu Y, Han L, Chen Y, Gao G, Wang M, Su T, Li H, Fang L, Sun N, Du H, Zheng J, Wang G	The main challenges in current immunotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lie in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Considering tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant immune cells in the TME, resetting TAMs is a promising strategy for ameliorating the immunosuppressive TME. Here, we developed genetically engineered macrophages (GEMs) with gene-carrying adenoviruses, to maintain the M1-like phenotype and directly deliver the immune regulators IL-12 and CXCL9 into local tumors, thereby reversing the immunosuppressive TME. In tumor bearing mice, GEMs demonstrated targeted enrichment in tumors and successfully reprogramed TAMs to M1-like macrophages. Moreover, GEMs significantly enhanced the accumulation, proliferation, and activation of CD8(+) T cells, mature dendritic cells (DCs), and natural killer (NK) cells within tumors, while diminishing M2-like macrophages, immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs). This treatment efficiently suppressed tumor growth. In addition, combination therapy with GEMs and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (αPD-1) further improved IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) T cell percentages and tumor inhibition efficacy in an orthotopic murine TNBC model. Therefore, this study provides a novel strategy for reversing the immunosuppressive TME and improving immunotherapeutic efficacy through live macrophage-mediated gene delivery.

Dai L, Ye K, Yao G, Lin J, Tan Z, Wei J, Hu Y, Luo J, Fang Y, Chen W	BACKGROUND: Accurately assessing the prognosis of bladder cancer patients after radical cystectomy has important clinical and research implications. Current models, based on traditional statistical approaches and complex variables, have limited performance. We aimed to develop a machine learning (ML)-based prognostic model to predict 5-year cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy, and compare its performance with current validated models. METHODS: Patients were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University for model construction and validation. We used univariate and multivariate Cox regression to select variables with independent prognostic significance for inclusion in the model's construction. Six ML algorithms and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to construct prediction models. Concordance index (C-index) and Brier scores were used to compare the discrimination and calibration of these models. The Shapley additive explanation method was used to explain the best-performing model. Finally, we compared this model with three existing prognostic models in urothelial carcinoma patients using C-index, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Brier scores, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: This study included 8,380 patients, with 6,656 in the training set, 1,664 in the internal validation set, and 60 in the external validation set. Eight features were ultimately identified to build models. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model showed the best performance in predicting 5-year CSM in bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy (internal validation: C-index = 0.723, Brier score = 0.191; external validation: C-index = 0.791, Brier score = 0.134). The lymph node density and tumor stage have the most significant impact on the prediction. In comparison with current validated models, our model also demonstrated the best discrimination and calibration (internal validation: C-index = 0.718, AUC = 0.779, Brier score = 0.191; external validation: C-index = 0.789, AUC = 0.884, Brier score = 0.137). Finally, calibration curves and DCA exhibited better predictive performance as well.

The role of circRNAs in cancer metabolism is poorly studied. Specifically, the impact of circPVT1, a well-known oncogenic circRNA on triple negative breast cancer metabolism is mechanistically underexplored. METHODS: The clinical significance of circPVT1 expression levels was assessed in human breast cancer samples using digital PCR and the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) dataset. The oncogenic activity of circPVT1 was assessed in TNBC cell lines and in MCF-10 A breast cell line by either ectopic expression or depletion of circPVT1 molecule. CircPVT1 mediated metabolic perturbation was assessed by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy metabolic profiling. The binding of circPVT1 to miR-33a-5p and c-Myc recruitment onto the Glutaminase gene promoter were assessed by RNA immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, respectively. The circPVT1/miR-33a-5p/Myc/GLS1 axis was functionally validated in breast cancer patients derived organoids. The viability of 2D and PDO cell models was assessed by ATP light assay and Opera Phenix plus high content screening. RESULTS: We initially found that the expression of circPVT1 was significantly higher in tumoral tissues than in non-tumoral breast tissues. Basal like breast cancer patients with higher levels of circPVT1 exhibited shorter disease-free survival compared to those with lower expression. CircPVT1 ectopic expression rendered fully transformed MCF-10 A immortalized breast cells and increased tumorigenicity of TNBC cell lines. Depletion of endogenous circPVT1 reduced tumorigenicity of SUM-159PT and MDA-MB-468 cells. 1 H-NMR spectroscopy metabolic profiling of circPVT1 depleted breast cancer cell lines revealed reduced glycolysis and glutaminolitic fluxes. Conversely, MCF-10 A cells stably overexpressing circPVT1 exhibited increased glutaminolysis. Mechanistically, circPVT1 sponges miR-33a-5p, a well know metabolic microRNA, which in turn releases c-MYC activity promoting transcriptionally glutaminase. This activity facilitates the conversion of glutamine to glutamate. CircPVT1 depletion synergizes with GLS1 inhibitors BPTES or CB839 to reduce cell viability of breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer-derived organoids. CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, our findings unveil the circPVT1/miR-33a-5p/Myc/GLS1 axis as a pro-tumorigenic metabolic event sustaining breast cancer transformation with potential therapeutic implications.

MAFLD represents a continuum of liver damage, spanning from uncomplicated steatosis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). This condition can advance to more severe outcomes, including fibrosis and cirrhosis. Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are a family of four receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR1-4) that interact with both paracrine and endocrine fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). This interaction activates the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase residues, thereby triggering downstream signaling pathways, including RAS-MAPK, JAK-STAT, PI3K-AKT, and PLCγ. In the context of MAFLD, paracrine FGF-FGFR signaling is predominantly biased toward the development of liver fibrosis and carcinogenesis. In contrast, endocrine FGF-FGFR signaling is primarily biased toward regulating the metabolism of bile acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and phosphate, as well as maintaining the overall balance of energy metabolism in the body. The interplay between these biased signaling pathways significantly influences the progression of MAFLD. This review explores the critical functions of FGFR signaling in MAFLD from three perspectives: first, it examines the primary roles of FGFRs relative to their structure; second, it summarizes FGFR signaling in hepatic lipid metabolism, elucidating mechanisms underlying the occurrence and progression of MAFLD; finally, it highlights recent advancements in drug development aimed at targeting FGFR signaling for the treatment of MAFLD and its associated diseases.

Suda Y, Ikuta K, Hayashi S, Wada K, Anjiki K, Kamenaga T, Tsubosaka M, Kuroda Y, Nakano N, Maeda T, Tsumiyama K, Matsumoto T, Kuroda R, Matsubara T	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) involves synovial tissue proliferation, inflammation, and angiogenesis, and contributes to joint destruction. Angiogenesis is a key therapeutic target for the treatment of RA, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have emerged as a promising therapy. In this study, we compared the inhibitory effects of five JAK inhibitors, including tofacitinib (TOF), baricitinib, peficitinib, upadacitinib, and filgotinib, on interleukin (IL)-6-induced inflammation in RA synovial tissues. All five inhibitors effectively suppressed IL-6-induced inflammatory and angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, by inhibiting the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT3. Overall, the results suggest that while all five JAK inhibitors are effective in reducing IL-6-induced inflammatory and angiogenic factors, their efficacy may differ owing to specific molecular mechanisms and pharmacological properties.

Zeymer U, Hassinger F, Bramlage P, Schäfer A, Westermann D, Thiele H	BACKGROUND: Patients with acute anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are at high risk for death and heart failure (HF) despite treatment with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Adjunctive therapy with hyperoxemic supersaturated oxygen (SSO2) following PCI reduced infarct size in previous randomized trials, but none of these trials were powered for clinical endpoints. AIMS: The HOT-AAMI trial evaluates whether hyperoxemic supersaturated oxygen (SSO2) therapy following PCI reduces the risk of death and heart failure. METHODS: HOT-AAMI is a multicenter, 1:1 randomized, open-label study across 50 sites in Germany. Patients presenting with anterior STEMI and undergoing successful PCI of the left anterior descending artery are randomized to receive SSO2 therapy on top of standard care or standard of care alone. The primary endpoint is a composite of all-cause mortality or unplanned heart failure hospital admission or outpatient visit due to heart failure requiring intravenous diuretic therapy during 12-48 months follow-up. Secondary endpoints include cardiovascular mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, and quality of life. The sample size calculation for the HOT-AAMI trial is based on detecting a relative reduction of 25% in the primary composite endpoint. In the control group, a yearly event rate of 16% is expected, comprised of mortality (7%), hospitalization for heart failure (5%), and acute heart failure requiring outpatient treatment (4%). The study is designed to detect this 25 % relative difference with a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and 80% power, requiring a total of 393 events; therefore 1266 patients will be enrolled. CONCLUSIONS: The HOT-AAMI trial is the first trial powered to determine whether SSO2 therapy, administered immediately post-PCI, improves death and heart failure outcomes in patients with anterior STEMI.

10.1186/s12967-025-06347-z	Integrating single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data to characterize the heterogeneity of glycan-lipid metabolism polarization in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Lin P, Qin Q, Gan XY, Pang JS, Wen R, He Y, Yang H	BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is high heterogeneity and remains an unmet medical challenge, but their metabolic heterogeneity has not been fully uncovered and required clinical applicable translational strategies. METHODS: By analyzing the RNA sequencing data in the in-house cohort and public HCC cohorts, we identified a metabolic subtype of HCC associated with multi-omics features and prognosis. Multi-omics alterations and clinicopathological information between different subtypes were analyzed. Gene signature, radiomics, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), serum biomarkers were tested as potential surrogate methods for high throughput technology-based subtyping. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses were employed to evaluate the immune characteristics changes between subtypes. RESULTS: By utilizing metabolic-related pathways, we identified two heterogeneous metabolic HCC subtypes, glycan-HCC and lipid-HCC, with distinct multi-omics features and prognosis. Kaplan-Meier and restricted mean survival time analyses revealed worse overall survival in glycan-HCCs. And glycan-HCCs were characterized with high genomic instability, proliferation-related pathways activation and exhausted immune microenvironment. Furthermore, we developed gene signatures, radiomics, CEUS and serum biomarkers for subtypes determination, which showed substantial agreement with high-throughput-based classification. Single-cell RNA-seq showed glycan-HCCs were associated with multifaceted immune distortion, including exhaustion of T cells and enriched SPP1 + macrophages. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our analysis demonstrated the metabolic heterogeneity of HCCs and enabled the development of clinical translation strategies, thus promoting understanding and clinical applications about HCC metabolism heterogeneity.

Scortegagna M, Murad R, Bina P, Feng Y, Porritt RA, Terskikh AV, Tian X, Adams PD, Vuori K, Ronai ZA	Aging is a known risk factor for melanoma, yet mechanisms underlying melanoma progression and metastasis in older populations remain largely unexplored. Aging might alter phenotypes of cells in the melanoma microenvironment, selecting for populations that support metastatic progression. Here, we demonstrated that age engenders the development of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which is linked to phenotypes associated with melanoma metastasis. Among cellular populations enriched by aging were macrophages with a tolerogenic phenotype expressing TREM2 and dysfunctional CD8+ T cells with an exhausted phenotype, while macrophages with a profibrotic phenotype expressing TREM1 were depleted. Notably, TREM1 inhibition decreased melanoma growth in young but not old mice, whereas TREM2 inhibition prevented lung metastasis in aged mice. These data identify age-related targets associated with melanoma metastasis and may guide aged-dependent immunotherapeutic strategies.

10.1186/s13054-025-05343-5	Ventilation-induced acute kidney injury in acute respiratory failure: Do PEEP levels matter? PG - 130 LID - 10.	Benites MH, Suarez-Sipmann F, Kattan E, Cruces P, Retamal J	"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients, and mechanical ventilation (MV) plays a critical role in its management. One of the key parameters of MV is the level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which helps to maintain an adequate lung functional volume. However, the optimal level of PEEP remains controversial. The classical approach in clinical trials for identifying the optimal PEEP has been to compare ""high"" and ""low"" levels in a dichotomous manner. High PEEP can improve lung compliance and significantly enhance oxygenation but has been inconclusive in hard clinical outcomes such as mortality and duration of MV. This discrepancy could be related to the fact that inappropriately high or low PEEP levels may adversely affect other organs, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys, which could counteract its potential beneficial effects on the lung. Patients with ARDS often develop acute kidney injury, which is an independent marker of mortality. Three primary mechanisms have been proposed to explain lung-kidney crosstalk during MV: gas exchange abnormalities, such as hypoxemia and hypercapnia; remote biotrauma; and hemodynamic changes, including reduced venous return and cardiac output. As PEEP levels increase, lung volume expands to a variable extent depending on mechanical response. This dynamic underlies two potential mechanisms that could impair venous return, potentially leading to splanchnic and renal congestion. First, increasing PEEP may enhance lung aeration, particularly in highly recruitable lungs, where previously collapsed alveoli reopen, increasing lung volume and pleural pressure, leading to vena cava compression, which can contribute to systemic venous congestion and abdominal organ impairment function. Second, in lungs with low recruitability, PEEP elevation may induce minimal changes in lung volume while increasing airway pressure, resulting in alveolar overdistension, vascular compression, and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Therefore, we propose that high PEEP settings can contribute to renal congestion, potentially impairing renal function. This review underscores the need for further rigorous research to validate these perspectives and explore strategies for optimizing PEEP settings while minimizing adverse renal effects."

Shahid T, Danazumi AU, Tehseen M, Alhudhali L, Clark AR, Savva CG, Hamdan SM, De Biasio A	Hexameric helicases are nucleotide-driven molecular machines that unwind DNA to initiate replication across all domains of life. Despite decades of intensive study, several critical aspects of their function remain unresolved(1): the site and mechanism of DNA strand separation, the mechanics of unwinding propagation, and the dynamic relationship between nucleotide hydrolysis and DNA movement. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that the simian virus 40 large tumour antigen (LTag) helicase assembles in the form of head-to-head hexamers at replication origins, melting DNA at two symmetrically positioned sites to establish bidirectional replication forks. Through continuous heterogeneity analysis(2), we characterize the conformational landscape of LTag on forked DNA under catalytic conditions, demonstrating coordinated motions that drive DNA translocation and unwinding. We show that the helicase pulls the tracking strand through DNA-binding loops lining the central channel, while directing the non-tracking strand out of the rear, in a cyclic process. ATP hydrolysis functions as an 'entropy switch', removing blocks to translocation rather than directly powering DNA movement. Our structures show the allosteric couplings between nucleotide turnover and subunit motions that enable DNA unwinding while maintaining dedicated exit paths for the separated strands. These findings provide a comprehensive model for replication fork establishment and progression that extends from viral to eukaryotic systems. More broadly, they introduce fundamental principles of the mechanism by which ATP-dependent enzymes achieve efficient mechanical work through entropy-driven allostery.

10.1111/dom.16358	Global, regional and country-specific burden of chronic kidney disease due to type 1 diabetes mellitus: A systematic analysis of the 2021 global disease burden study.	Sun J, Hu W, Ye S, Xu M, Deng D, Chen M	AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects individual welfare, healthcare systems and societal progress. Of the multifaceted etiological factors, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a prominent contributor to CKD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed the global incidence, prevalence, deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) with age-standardised rates of CKD due to T1DM (CKD-T1DM) in 2021, stratified by subtype. We calculated the temporal trends in the infirmity burden from 1990 to 2019 using a linear regression model. The age-period-cohort (APC) and Bayesian APC models predicted the prospective burden over the next 25 years. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and Exponential Smoothing models. RESULTS: Globally, there were 95 140 incidences, 6 295 711 prevalence cases, 94 020 deaths and 3 875 628 DALYs due to CKD-T1DM. Males and young-to-middle-aged individuals were more likely to be affected by CKD-T1DM. The middle-socio-demographic index regions were at higher risk. A considerable variation in disease burden was observed across the Global Burden of Disease super regions and countries. The number of patients with CKD-T1DM surged globally from 1990 to 2021. The projections indicated a continuous increase until 2046, driven by ageing populations and unmet therapeutic needs in low-resource settings. CONCLUSIONS: CKD-T1DM poses a growing public health threat, necessitating region-specific strategies that address healthcare inequities, promote early screening and prioritise nephroprotective therapies among T1DM populations.	Diabetes, obesity & metabolism	21/03/2025	Global, regional and country-specific burden of chronic kidney disease due to type 1 diabetes mellitus: A systematic analysis of the 2021 global disease burden study.. AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects individual welfare, healthcare systems and societal progress. Of the multifaceted etiological factors, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a prominent contributor to CKD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed the global incidence, prevalence, deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) with age-standardised rates of CKD due to T1DM (CKD-T1DM) in 2021, stratified by subtype. We calculated the temporal trends in the infirmity burden from 1990 to 2019 using a linear regression model. The age-period-cohort (APC) and Bayesian APC models predicted the prospective burden over the next 25 years. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and Exponential Smoothing models. RESULTS: Globally, there were 95 140 incidences, 6 295 711 prevalence cases, 94 020 deaths and 3 875 628 DALYs due to CKD-T1DM.

Meng C, Guo W, Xiao C, Wen Y, Zhu X, Zhang Q, Liang Y, Li H, Xu S, Qiu Y, Chen H, Lin WJ, Wu B	Psilocybin shows significant therapeutic potential for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in addressing various psychiatric conditions. The biosynthetic approach promises rapid and efficient production of psilocybin. Understanding the enzymes that contribute to the biosynthesis of psilocybin can enhance its production process. In this study, we elucidate the crystal structures of L-tryptophan-specific decarboxylase PsiD in both its apo and tryptamine-bound states, the 4-hydroxytryptamine kinase PsiK bound to its substrate, and several forms of the methyltransferase PsiM in either apo or substrate-bound forms derived from the psychedelic mushroom. Structure-based evaluations reveal the mechanisms of self-cleavage and self-inhibition in PsiD, along with the sequential catalytic steps from 4-hydroxytryptamine to the final compound, psilocybin. Additionally, we showcase the antidepressant properties of biosynthetic intermediates of psilocybin on female mice experiencing depression-like behaviors induced by sub-chronic variable stress. Our studies establish a structural basis for the future biosynthetic production of psilocybin using these enzymes and emphasize the clinical potential of norbaeocystin.

Sultan S, Shung DL, Kolb JM, Foroutan F, Hassan C, Kahi CJ, Liang PS, Levin TR, Siddique SM, Lebwohl B	BACKGROUND & AIMS: This American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline is intended to provide an overview of the evidence and support endoscopists and patients on the use of computer-aided detection (CADe) systems for the detection of colorectal polyps during colonoscopy. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of content experts and guideline methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework and relied on the following sources of evidence: (1) a systematic review examining the desirable and undesirable effects (ie, benefits and harms) of CADe-assisted colonoscopy, (2) a microsimulation study estimating the effects of CADe on longer-term patient-important outcomes, (3) a systematic search of evidence evaluating the values and preferences of patients undergoing colonoscopy, and (4) a systematic review of studies evaluating health care providers' trust in artificial intelligence technology in gastroenterology. RESULTS: The panel reached the conclusion that no recommendation could be made for or against the use of CADe-assisted colonoscopy in light of very low certainty of evidence for the critical outcomes, desirable and undesirable (11 fewer colorectal cancers per 10,000 individuals and 2 fewer colorectal cancer deaths per 10,000 individuals), increased burden of more intensive surveillance colonoscopies (635 more per 10,000 individuals), and cost and resource implications. The panel acknowledged the 8% (95% CI, 6%-10%) increase in adenoma detection rate and 2% (95% CI, 0%-4%) increase in advanced adenoma and/or sessile serrated lesion detection rate. CONCLUSIONS: This guideline highlights the close tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects and the limitations in the current evidence to support a recommendation. The panel acknowledged the potential for CADe to continually improve as an iterative artificial intelligence application. Ongoing publications providing evidence for critical outcomes will help inform a future recommendation.

Wang Z, Zhu Y, Yao Y, Zhang W, Wang B, Wang J, Yang Y, Liu L	Adriamycin (ADR), as an anti-cancer drug in routine clinical application, is utilized to treat various cancers such as ovarian cancer, hematological malignant tumor, and endometrial carcinoma. However, its serious dose-dependent cardiotoxicity extremely limits its clinical application. Currently, there remains a dearth of therapeutic agents to mitigate ADR-induced cardiotoxicity. Extensive research has demonstrated that ADR can simultaneously trigger various regulated cell death (RCD) pathways, such as apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. Therefore, drugs targeting these RCD pathways may represent effective strategies for treating ADR-induced cardiotoxicity. Natural products, with their wide availability, low cost, and diverse pharmacological activities, have increasingly gained attention. Various natural products, including polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids, can target the RCD pathways involved in ADR-induced cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, these natural products have exhibited excellent properties in preclinical studies or in vitro experiments. This review summarizes the mechanisms of RCD in ADR-induced cardiotoxicity and systematically reviews the natural products targeting these RCD pathways. Finally, we propose future research directions of natural products in this field.

10.1099/mic.0.001144	Rare actinobacteria isolated from the hypersaline Ojo de Liebre Lagoon as a source of novel bioactive compounds with biotechnological potential.	Zamora-Quintero AY, Torres-Beltrán M, Guillén Matus DG, Oroz-Parra I, Millán-Aguiñaga N	The Ojo de Liebre Lagoon is a Marine Protected Area that lies within a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is a critical habitat for important migratory species such as the grey whale and bird species. Unique hypersaline environments, such as the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon, are underexplored in terms of their bacterial and chemical diversity, representing a potential source for new bioactive compounds with pharmacological properties. Actinobacteria are one of the most diverse and prolific taxonomic bacterial groups in terms of marine bioactive compounds. This study aimed to identify the culturable actinobacterial community inhabiting the Lagoon, as well as to test their potential as new sources of anticancer compounds with pharmacological potential. A selective isolation approach focused on spore-forming bacteria from 40 sediment samples generated a culture collection of 64 strains. The 16S rRNA gene analyses identified three phyla in this study, the Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, where the phylum Actinobacteria dominated (57%) the microbial community profiles. Within the Actinobacteria, nine different genera were isolated including the Actinomadura, Micromonospora, Nocardiopsis, Plantactinospora and Streptomyces sp. We observed seasonal differences on actinobacteria recovery. For instance, Micromonospora strains were recovered during the four sampling seasons, while Arthrobacter and Pseudokineococcus were only isolated in February 2018, and Blastococcus, Rhodococcus and Streptomyces were uniquely isolated in June 2018. Ethyl acetate crude extracts derived from actinobacterial cultures were generated and screened for cytotoxic activity against six cancer cell lines. Strains showed promising low percentages of viability on lung (H1299), cervical (SiHa), colon (Caco-2) and liver (HepG2) cancer lines. Molecular networking results suggest many of the metabolites produced by these strains are unknown and they might harbour novel chemistry. Our results showed the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon is a novel source for isolating diverse marine actinobacteria which produce promising bioactive compounds for potential biotechnological use as anticancer agents.

Wang Q, Wen Y, Bi B, Li K, Liu Y, Li B, Zhou S, Li Z, Xu J, Qiu M, Li Y, Wu M, Chen Y, Wu W, Zhao J	Peritoneal metastasis (PM) is typically intractable by immunotherapy due to an immunosuppressive microenvironment and the peritoneal-plasma barrier. Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) presents unique advantages of noninvasive in situ treatment and the potential for antitumor immune activation. Building upon SDT technology, the study reports on a novel biodegradable sonosensitizer, CaS(2)O(8), characterized by a narrow bandgap, abundant oxygen vacancies and a rapid ultrasound (US) response for abdominal SDT. Such sonosensitizer only produces lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) after US irradiation, which is nontoxic in a physiological environment. After US irradiation, CaS(2)O(8) yields a large amount of sulfate radical (SO(4)(-)), as well as sonodynamic related ROS (OH, and (1)O(2)), which exerts a synergistic effect with Ca(2+) overload to induce Z-conformation nucleic acid by augmenting oxidative damage. As a result, the PANoptosis is initiated through the ZBP1/RIPK3 pathway in tumor cells. This inflammatory cell death leads to a multi-faceted release of tumor cell contents which serve as an in situ tumor antigen to induce a robust antitumor immune response. Notably, the precision sono-immunotherapy enhances the infiltration of T cells into tumors by transforming an immunosuppressive phenotype into an immunostimulatory one. Therefore, targeting PANoptosis by CaS(2)O(8)-induced SDT can provide an alternative or additional clinical treatment and prolonged survival outcome for patients with PM.

10.1016/j.phymed.2025.156569	Combined metabolomics and network pharmacology to elucidate the mechanisms of Huiyang Shengji decoction in treating diabetic skin ulcer mice.	Chen J, Qu B, Yang D, Wang Y, Zhu H, Wang Z, Zhang X, Ma H, Zhao N, Zhao L, Zhou L, He X, Li P	BACKGROUND: Diabetic skin ulcer is a clinical disorder of glucose metabolism that has a long treatment period and is prone to recurrent episodes. Huiyang Shengji decoction (HYSJD) is an effective traditional Chinese medicine for its clinical treatment, but its metabolic effects in patients with diabetic skin ulcers have not been well studied. PURPOSE: Our study aimed to investigate the mechanism of pharmacological treatment of HYSJD in treating diabetic skin ulcers. METHODS: The potential mechanism underlying diabetic wound treatment by HYSJD was screened using network pharmacology. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-MS/MS metabolomics analysis and correlation analysis were performed to investigate potential target pathways and genes. Furthermore, the db/db diabetic wound tissues and RAW264.7 macrophage inflammation model verified the mechanism using molecular biology experiments. RESULTS: In network pharmacology, HYSJD played a mainly therapeutic effect by regulating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, metabolic pathway, and other related metabolic-related pathways. Metabolomics analysis disclosed that L-lysine content increased, while those of linoleic and deoxycholic acids decreased in plasma between the HYSJD-treated group and the control group, participating in biotin metabolism. Among them, PPARγ played an important role. The experiments conducted in db/db mice indicated that HYSJD facilitates VEGF secretion and PPARγ expression. In vitro experiments have revealed that HYSJD inhibits macrophage ROS production, augments mitochondrial ATP production, elevates mitochondrial membrane potential, and diminishes the mitochondrial ECAR rate. Furthermore, these effects culminate in promoting M2 macrophage polarization through PPARγ activation. The molecular docking results revealed that the active compounds from HYSJD were capable of binding to PPARγ protein primarily through hydrogen bonding interactions. Notably, all binding energies were found to be lower than -3 kcal/mol, indicating strong and favorable interactions between the active compounds and the target receptor. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that HYSJD regulates biotin metabolism by reducing excess levels of linoleic and deoxycholic acids and increasing levels of L-lysine, which in turn promotes diabetic wound healing by promoting M2 macrophage polarization through PPARγ up-regulation. These findings indicated that HYSJD is a decoction that can effectively treat diabetic skin ulcers.

The molecular docking results revealed that the active compounds from HYSJD were capable of binding to PPARγ protein primarily through hydrogen bonding interactions. Notably, all binding energies were found to be lower than -3 kcal/mol, indicating strong and favorable interactions between the active compounds and the target receptor. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that HYSJD regulates biotin metabolism by reducing excess levels of linoleic and deoxycholic acids and increasing levels of L-lysine, which in turn promotes diabetic wound healing by promoting M2 macrophage polarization through PPARγ up-regulation. These findings indicated that HYSJD is a decoction that can effectively treat diabetic skin ulcers.	combined metabolomic network pharmacology to elucidate mechanism huiyang shengji decoction treat diabetic skin ulcer mouse background diabetic skin ulcer be clinical disorder glucose metabolism have long treatment period be prone recurrent episode huiyang shengji decoction hysjd be effective traditional chinese medicine clinical treatment metabolic effect patient diabetic skin ulcer have not be well study purpose study aim to investigate mechanism pharmacological treatment hysjd treat diabetic skin ulcer method potential mechanism underlie diabetic wound treatment hysjd be screen use network pharmacology ultra high performance liquid chromatography ms ms metabolomic analysis correlation analysis be perform to investigate potential target pathway gene furthermore db db diabetic wound tissue token0.7 macrophage inflammation model verify mechanism use molecular biology experiment result network pharmacology hysjd play mainly therapeutic effect regulate PI3K akt signal pathway egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance metabolic pathway other relate metabolic relate pathway metabolomic analysis disclose l lysine content increase linoleic deoxycholic acid decrease plasma hysjd treat group control group participate biotin metabolism pparγ play important role experiment conduct db db mouse indicate hysjd facilitate vegf secretion pparγ expression vitro experiment have reveal hysjd inhibit macrophage ros production augment mitochondrial atp production elevate mitochondrial membrane potential diminish mitochondrial ecar rate furthermore effect culminate promote m2 macrophage polarization pparγ activation molecular docking result reveal active compound hysjd be capable bind pparγ protein primarily hydrogen bonding interaction notably bind energy be find to be low -3 kcal mol indicate strong favorable interaction active compound target receptor conclusion finding suggest hysjd regulate biotin metabolism reduce excess level linoleic deoxycholic acid increase level l lysine turn promote diabetic wound healing promote m2 macrophage polarization pparγ up regulation finding indicate hysjd be decoction can effectively treat diabetic skin ulcer
10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.1421	Seven vs Fourteen Days of Antibiotics for Gram-Negative Bloodstream Infection: A Systematic Review and Noninferiority Meta-Analysis.	Lee TC, Prosty CJ, Fralick M, Huttner A, McDonald EG, Molina J, Paul M, Pinto R, Rishu A, von Dach E, Yahav D, Fowler R, Daneman N	IMPORTANCE: Gram-negative bloodstream infections are a common cause of hospitalization. A 2-week duration of antibiotic therapy has been commonly used, but shorter durations may have similar outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether 7 days of antibiotic therapy was noninferior to 14 days. DATA SOURCES: Starting with a 2022 individual patient data meta-analysis, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched to identify additional eligible randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted from May 1, 2022, until November 30, 2024. STUDY SELECTION: RCTs involving primarily adults who were hospitalized at the time of Gram-negative bloodstream infection and were allocated to 7 or 14 days of antibiotic therapy. Studies were independently reviewed by 2 investigators. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: PRISMA guidelines were followed. Data were extracted by 2 investigators. Any unpublished data were obtained directly from study authors. Risk of bias and certainty of the evidence were assessed in duplicate using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, version 2, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Data were pooled by separate random-effects meta-analyses for the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations. A noninformative prior probability was used for the effect, and an evidence-based weakly informative prior probability was used for heterogeneity. Risk ratios (RRs), 95% credible intervals (CrIs), and probability of noninferiority were calculated using a prespecified upper bound of 1.25 or less. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Ninety-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Four eligible RCTs contributed 3729 patients in the ITT population (1912 women [51.3%]; median age range, 67-79 years) and 3126 in the PP population. In the ITT analysis, within 90 days, 226 patients (12.8%) receiving 7 days of antibiotics died compared with 253 (13.7%) receiving 14 days, corresponding to an RR for 90-day mortality of 0.91 (95% CrI, 0.69-1.22) and a 97.8% probability of noninferiority. In the PP analysis, the RR was 0.93 (95% CrI, 0.68-1.32), corresponding to a 95.1% probability of noninferiority. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infections and adequate source control, 7 days of antibiotic therapy had a high probability of being noninferior to 14 days. These findings support a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy for appropriately selected patients like those in the included RCTs.

Immune system dysregulation and inflammation, particularly microglial mediated, may underlie this risk, but mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: Using a high-fat diet-fed (HFD) model, we assessed longitudinal metabolism and cognition, and terminal inflammation and brain spatial transcriptomics. Additionally, we performed hippocampal spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing of post mortem tissue from AD and T2D human subjects versus controls. RESULTS: HFD induced progressive metabolic and CI with terminal inflammatory changes, and dysmetabolic, neurodegenerative, and inflammatory gene expression profiles, particularly in microglia. AD and T2D human subjects had similar gene expression changes, including in secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), a pro-inflammatory gene associated with AD. DISCUSSION: These data show that metabolic stressors cause early and progressive CI, with inflammatory changes that promote disease. They also indicate a role for microglia, particularly microglial SPP1, in CI. HIGHLIGHTS: Metabolic stress causes persistent metabolic and cognitive impairments in mice. Murine and human brain spatial transcriptomics align and indicate a pro-inflammatory milieu. Transcriptomic data indicate a role for microglial-mediated inflammatory mechanisms. Secreted phosphoprotein 1 emerged as a potential target of interest in metabolically driven cognitive impairment.

10.1186/s40478-025-01984-3	Curative timed NK cell-based immunochemotherapy aborts brain tumour recurrence driven by mesenchymal glioma stem cells.	Meehan B, Adnani L, Zhu X, Tawil N, Garnier D, Nakano I, Huang S, Rak J	High grade gliomas (HGG) are incurable brain cancers, where inevitable disease recurrence is driven by tumour-initiating glioma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs survive and expand in the brain after surgery, radiation and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, amidst weak immune and natural killer (NK) cell surveillance. The present study was designed to understand how to enhance the contribution of innate immunity to post TMZ disease control. Strikingly, molecular subtypes of HGG impacted the repertoire of NK cell sensitivity markers across human HGG transcriptomes, and in a panel of GSCs with either proneural (PN-GSC) or mesenchymal (MES-GSC) phenotypes. Indeed, only MES-GSCs (but not PN-GSCs) were enriched for NK cell ligands and sensitive to NK-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. While NK cells alone had no effect on HGG progression in vivo, the post-chemotherapy (TMZ) recurrence of MES-GSC-driven xenografts was aborted by timed intracranial injection of live or irradiated NK (NK92MI) cells, resulting in long term survival of animals. This curative effect declined when NK cell administration was delayed relative to TMZ exposure pointing to limits of the immune control over resurging residual tumour stem cell populations that survived chemotherapy. Overall, these results suggest that chemotherapy-dependent tumour depopulation may create a unique window of opportunity for NK-mediated intervention with curative effects restricted to a subset of HGGs driven by mesenchymal brain tumour initiating cells.

Despite a comparatively high prevalence, the longitudinal landscape remains relatively unexplored, and complete characterization is essential for clinical trial readiness. METHODS: We combined electronic medical record data (n=158) with insurance claims data (n=246) to evaluate longitudinal progression of symptoms. RESULTS: Phenotypes associated with SYNGAP1 included behavioral abnormalities (Odds ratio (OR) 12.35, 95% CI 9.21-16.78), generalized-onset seizures (OR 1.56, CI 1.20-2.02), autism (OR 12.23, CI 9.29-16.24), and a developmental profile with prominent deficits in verbal skill acquisition. Several clinical features showed distinct age-related patterns, such as a more than five-fold risk of autistic behavior emerging between 27 and 30 months. Generalized-onset seizures were significantly increased (OR 4.05, CI 2.02-7.59) after 3 years of age and persisted over time. Valproic acid and clobazam were commonly used for epilepsy treatment, while risperidone, aripiprazole, and guanfacine were commonly used for behavior management. Valproate and lamotrigine were more effective at reducing seizure frequencies or maintaining seizure freedom than other anti-seizure medications. CONCLUSION: We delineated the seizure, developmental, and behavioral trajectories in SYNGAP1-related disorders, to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical care, as well as facilitating clinical trial readiness.

10.2196/56975	Effectiveness of Digital Lifestyle Interventions on Depression, Anxiety, Stress, and Well-Being: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Brinsley J, O'Connor EJ, Singh B, McKeon G, Curtis R, Ferguson T, Gosse G, Willems I, Marent PJ, Szeto K, Firth J, Maher C	BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of robust evidence to show that lifestyle behaviors influence mental health outcomes. Technology offers an accessible and cost-effective implementation method for interventions, yet the study of the effectiveness of interventions to date has been specific to the mode of delivery, population, or behavior. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this review was to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of digital lifestyle interventions for improving symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and well-being as coprimary outcomes in adults. The secondary aim was to explore the technological, methodological, intervention-specific, and population-specific characteristics that were associated with major changes in mental health outcomes. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across the MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Emcare, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases to identify studies published between January 2013 and January 2023. Randomized controlled trials of lifestyle interventions (physical activity, sleep, and diet) that were delivered digitally; reported changes in symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, or well-being in adults (aged ≥18 years); and were published in English were included. Multiple authors independently extracted data, which was evaluated using the 2011 Levels of Evidence from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Inverse-variance random-effects meta-analyses were used for data analysis. The primary outcome was the change in symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and well-being as measured by validated self-report of clinician-administered outcomes from pre- to postintervention. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether results differed based on the target lifestyle behavior, delivery method, digital features, design features, or population characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 14,356 studies identified, 61 (0.42%) were included. Digital lifestyle interventions had a significant small-to-medium effect on depression (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.37; P<.001), a small effect on anxiety (SMD -0.29; P<.001) and stress (SMD -0.17; P=.04), and no effect on well-being (SMD 0.14; P=.15). Subgroup analyses generally suggested that effects were similar regardless of the delivery method or features used, the duration and frequency of the intervention, the population, or the lifestyle behavior targeted. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicate that delivering lifestyle interventions via a range of digital methods can have significant positive effects on depression (P<.001), anxiety (P<.001), and stress (P=.04) for a broad range of populations, while effects on well-being are inconclusive. Future research should explore how these interventions can be effectively implemented and embedded within health care with a concerted focus on addressing digital health equity.

Yaku K, Palikhe S, Iqbal T, Hayat F, Watanabe Y, Fujisaka S, Izumi H, Yoshida T, Karim M, Uchida H, Nawaz A, Tobe K, Mori H, Migaud ME, Nakagawa T	Decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD(+)) levels are reportedly associated with several aging-related disorders. Thus, supplementation with NAD(+) precursors, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside (NR), exhibits beneficial effects against these disorders. However, the in vivo metabolic pathways of NMN and NR remain to be elucidated. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the fate of orally and intravenously administered NMN and NR in mice using NAD(+) metabolomics. We found that only a small portion of orally administered NMN and NR was directly absorbed from the small intestine and that most of them underwent gut microbiota-mediated deamidation and conversion to nicotinic acid (NA). Moreover, intravenously administered NMN and NR were rapidly degraded into nicotinamide and secreted to bile followed by deamidation to NA by gut microbiota. Thus, enterohepatic circulated NA is preferentially used in the liver. These findings showed that NMN and NR are indirectly converted to NAD(+) via unexpected metabolic pathways.

These findings showed that NMN and NR are indirectly converted to NAD(+) via unexpected metabolic pathways.	nicotinamide riboside nicotinamide mononucleotide facilitate nad(+ synthesis enterohepatic circulation decrease nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidize form nad(+ level be reportedly associate several aging relate disorder thus supplementation nad(+ precursor such nicotinamide mononucleotide nmn nicotinamide riboside nr exhibit beneficial effect disorder however vivo metabolic pathway nmn nr remain to be elucidate study comprehensively analyze fate orally intravenously administer nmn nr mouse use nad(+ metabolomic find only small portion orally administer nmn nr be directly absorb small intestine most undergo gut microbiota mediate deamidation conversion nicotinic acid na moreover intravenously administer nmn nr be rapidly degrade nicotinamide secrete bile follow deamidation na gut microbiota thus enterohepatic circulate na be preferentially use liver finding show nmn nr be indirectly convert nad(+ unexpected metabolic pathway

Coughlin GM, Borsos M, Barcelona BH, Appling N, Mayfield AMH, Mackey ED, Eser RA, Jackson CR, Chen X, Kumar SR, Gradinaru V	Cell-type-specific regulatory elements such as enhancers can direct expression of recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to specific cell types, but this approach is limited by the relatively small packaging capacity of AAVs. In this study, we used spatial genomics to show that transcriptional crosstalk between individual AAV genomes provides a general method for cell-type-specific expression of large cargo by separating distally acting regulatory elements into a second AAV genome. We identified and profiled transcriptional crosstalk in AAV genomes carrying 11 different enhancers active in mouse brain. We developed spatial genomics methods to identify and localize AAV genomes and their concatemeric forms in cultured cells and in tissue, and we demonstrate here that transcriptional crosstalk is dependent upon concatemer formation. Finally, we leveraged transcriptional crosstalk to drive expression of a 3.2-kb Cas9 cargo in a cell-type-specific manner with systemically administered engineered AAVs, and we demonstrate AAV-delivered, minimally invasive, cell-type-specific gene editing in wild-type mice that recapitulates known disease phenotypes.

10.1097/MD.0000000000041851	Comparative analysis of demographic, clinical, biochemical, and predictors of mortality in COVID-19 and NON-COVID-19 ARDS patients: A retrospective cohort study.	Paulo MF, Lago AF, Bellíssimo-Rodrigues F, da Silva JM, Basile-Filho A	The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a significant increase in the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This retrospective study aims to compare the differences in demographic, clinical, and biochemical variables and predictive factors in 2 situations of ARDS cause (COVID-19 vs NON-COVID-19) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was performed for quantitative variables, and Fisher exact test for qualitative variables. 115 patients with ARDS were enrolled (53 patients with COVID-19 ARDS and 62 NON-COVID-19 ARDS). The COVID-19 ARDS group consisted of 33 male patients (66.2%), whereas the NON-COVID-19 ARDS group had 25 male patients (40.3%) (P = .0248). The median and interquartile age difference of the COVID-19 ARDS group was 64.0 [52.0-69.5], and non-COVID-19 ARDS was 49.0 [34.0-63.0] (P = .0011). Body mass index, simplified acute physiology score, sequential organ failure assessment, and intensive care unit length of stay, with P-values of .0061, .0002, .0003, and <.0001, respectively (COVID-19 vs NON-COVID-19 ARDS). Diabetes, arterial hypertension, venous thrombosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had values of <.0001, .0234, .0358, and .0001, respectively. On the other hand, the NON-COVID-19 ARDS group had a greater need for dialysis (P = .0109). The stepwise logistic regression showed that relevant clinical, and demographic characteristics associated with ARDS due to COVID-19, such as male gender, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and body mass index, were independent prognostic factors of severity in patients with COVID-19 ARDS, compared to NON-COVID-19 ARDS. The overall mortality rate was 62.9% for COVID-19 ARDS and 77.4% for the non-COVID-19 ARDS group (P = .2950). Ventilatory parameters of COVID-19 ARDS and NON-COVID-19 ARDS were similar.

10.1111/sms.70039	The Effect of an 8-Week Low- or High-Volume Protocol of the Adductor Strengthening Programme on Hip Adduction Strength in Female Football Players-A Randomized Trial.	Thorarinsdottir S, Isaksen Johansen S, Ruud Askim Elvestad T, Amundsen R, Bache-Mathiesen LK, Bahr R, Møller M	The aim of this study was to investigate if an 8-week high-volume protocol of the Adductor Strengthening Programme was more effective than a low-volume protocol in increasing and maintaining isometric hip adduction strength in female football players. We randomized 52 players from the Norwegian women's 1st and 2nd division to a low-volume (220 reps/side) or high-volume (394 reps/side) group. Both groups performed an 8-week protocol of the Adductor Strengthening Programme and a 10-week maintenance protocol with 1 session/week (16 reps/side/session). We measured isometric hip adductor torque (Nm/kg) in a long-lever squeeze test (at 0° and 15° hip abduction) using the ForceFrame at baseline, weeks 4, 6, 8, and 18. Both groups increased their isometric hip adduction strength over the 8-week period (low-volume 0°: 0.13 [95% CI: 0.07-0.20] Nm/kg, 15°: 0.22 [95% CI: 0.07-0.36] Nm/kg; high-volume 0°: 0.13 [95% CI: 0.04-0.22] Nm/kg, 15°: 0.31 [95% CI: 0.18-0.45] Nm/kg), with no between-group difference in either test position (0°: -0.01 [95% CI: -0.11-0.01] Nm/kg; 15°: 0.10 [95% CI: -0.09-0.29] Nm/kg). Also, both groups maintained their strength throughout the 10-week maintenance period, with no between-groups difference in either test position (0°: 0.12 [95% CI: -0.01-0.24] Nm/kg; 15°: 0.06 [95% CI: -0.11-0.23] Nm/kg). Our results indicate that an 8-week high-volume protocol of the Adductor Strengthening Programme was not more effective in increasing isometric adductor strength in female football players than a low-volume protocol. Both groups increased their strength over the 8-week training period and maintained their strength during the 10-week maintenance period.

10.1016/S2468-1253(25)00012-3	Per-oral endoscopic myotomy versus laparoscopic Heller's myotomy plus Dor fundoplication in patients with idiopathic achalasia: 5-year follow-up of a multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial.	Hugova K, Mares J, Hakanson B, Repici A, von Rahden BHA, Bredenoord AJ, Bisschops R, Messmann H, Ruppenthal T, Mann O, Izbicki J, Harustiak T, Fumagalli Romario U, Rosati R, Germer CT, Schijven M, Emmermann A, von Renteln D, Dautel S, Fockens P, Boeckxstaens G, Rösch T, Martinek J, Werner YB	BACKGROUND: In this trial, we previously showed per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) to be non-inferior to laparoscopic Heller's myotomy (LHM) plus Dor fundoplication in managing symptoms in patients with idiopathic achalasia 2 years post-procedure. However, post-procedural gastro-oesophageal reflux was more common after POEM at 2 years. Here we report 5-year follow-up data. METHODS: This study is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial performed at eight centres in six European countries (Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Belgium). Patients with symptomatic primary achalasia were eligible for inclusion if they were older than 18 years and had an Eckardt symptom score higher than 3. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1; randomly permuted blocks of sizes 4, 8, or 12) to undergo either POEM or LHM plus Dor fundoplication. The primary endpoint was clinical success, defined by an Eckardt symptom score of 3 or less without the use of additional treatments, at 2 years, and was reported previously. Prespecified secondary endpoints at 5 years were clinical success; Eckardt symptom score; Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index score; lower oesophageal sphincter function by high-resolution manometry; and parameters of post-procedural reflux (reflux oesophagitis according to the Los Angeles classification; pH-metry, and DeMeester clinical score). We hypothesised that POEM would be non-inferior (with a non-inferiority margin of -12·5 percentage points) to LHM plus Dor fundoplication with regards to clinical success. All analyses were performed on a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all patients who underwent the assigned procedure. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01601678) and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Dec 7, 2012, and Oct 9, 2015, 241 patients were randomly assigned (120 to POEM and 121 to LHM) and 221 had the assigned treatment (112 POEM and 109 LHM; mITT). 5-year follow up data were available for 90 (80%) patients in the POEM group and 87 (80%) patients in the LHM group. Clinical success rate at 5 years was 75·0% (95% CI 66·2 to 82·1) after POEM and 70·8% (61·7 to 78·5) after LHM (difference 4·2 percentage points [95% CI -7·4 to 15·7]). The mean Eckardt symptom score decreased from baseline to 5 years in both groups and the overall difference in mean scores was -0·29 (95% CI -0·62 to 0·05). Change in Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index scores, as well as in integrated relaxation pressure on manometry, from baseline to 5 years, did not differ significantly between the groups. At 5 years, 26 (41%) of 63 patients after POEM and 18 (31%) of 58 patients after LHM had reflux oesophagitis (difference 10·2 percentage points [95% CI -7·0 to 26·8]). Significant oesophagitis (Los Angeles classification grade B, C, or D) was observed in nine (14%) of 63 patients after POEM and in four (7%) of 58 patients after LHM. pH-metry was performed in 81 (37%) of 221 patients, with higher mean acid exposure time for POEM (10·2% [95% CI 7·6 to 14·2]) than for LHM (5·5% [3·1 to 11·8]). Significantly more patients in the POEM than in the LHM group had abnormal acid exposure time at 5 years (>4·5%; 28 [62%] of 45 vs 11 [31%] of 36; difference 31·7 percentage points [95% CI 9·8 to 50·5]). The presence of reflux symptoms at 5 years was similar in both groups, with a mean DeMeester clinical score of 1·3 (95% CI 1·0 to 1·6) after POEM and 1·1 (0·9 to 1·4) after LHM. The complications of peptic stricture, Barrett's oesophagus, and oesophageal adenocarcinoma were not reported. INTERPRETATION: Our long-term results support the role of POEM as a less invasive myotomy approach that is non-inferior to LHM in controlling symptoms of achalasia. Gastro-oesophageal reflux was common in both groups, but with a tendency towards higher rates in the POEM group. Thus, patients should be provided with the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in decision making.

10.1016/j.eururo.2025.02.019	European Association of Urology Guidelines on Muscle-invasive and Metastatic Bladder Cancer: Summary of the 2025 Guidelines.	van der Heijden AG, Bruins HM, Carrion A, Cathomas R, Compérat E, Dimitropoulos K, Efstathiou JA, Fietkau R, Kailavasan M, Lorch A, Martini A, Mertens LS, Meijer RP, Mariappan P, Milowsky MI, Neuzillet Y, Panebianco V, Sæbjørnsen S, Smith EJ, Thalmann GN, Rink M	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This publication represents a summary of the updated 2025 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer (MMIBC). The aim is to provide practical recommendations on the clinical management of MMIBC with a focus on diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. METHODS: For the 2025 guidelines, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: The key recommendations emphasise the importance of thorough diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for patients with MMIBC. The guidelines stress the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of MMIBC patients and the importance of shared decision-making with patients. The key changes in the 2025 muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) guidelines include the following: a new recommendation for the use of susceptible FGFR3 alterations to select patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma for treatment with erdafitinib; significant adaption and update of the recommendations for pre- and postoperative radiotherapy and sexual organ-preserving techniques in women; new recommendation related to radical cystectomy and extent of lymph node dissection based on the results of the SWOG trial; recommendation related to hospital volume; new recommendations for salvage cystectomy after trimodality therapy and for the management of all patients who are candidates for trimodality bladder-preserving treatment in a multidisciplinary team setting using a shared decision-making process; significant adaption and update to the recommendation for adjuvant nivolumab in selected patients with pT3/4 and/or pN+ disease not eligible for, or who declined, adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy; and addition of a new recommendation for metastatic disease regarding the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan in case of HER2 overexpression; in addition, removal of the recommendations on sacituzumab govitecan as the manufacturer has withdrawn the US Food and Drug Administration approval for this product; update of the follow-up of MIBC; and full update of the management algorithms of MIBC. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This overview of the 2025 EAU guidelines offers valuable insights into risk factors, diagnosis, classification, treatment, and follow-up of MIBC patients and is designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

Teng TQ, Wang MM, Mo DG, Xie YY, Chen R, Xu JC, Liu J, Yu HC	BACKGROUND: Individuals with low sexual frequency often experience comorbidities that exacerbate mortality. This article evaluates the predictive value of five body fat anthropometric indicators for all-cause mortality and explores the interaction between obesity and depression in mortality among young and middle-aged individuals with sexual frequency <12 times per year. METHODS: This study included participants with a sexual frequency of <12 times per year from the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We assessed the impact of anthropometric indicators and depression on mortality, as well as their synergistic interactions, and further developed an accessible predictive survival model. RESULTS: A total of 4978 participants aged 20-59 were included, with 215 deaths (4.3 %) over 15 years of follow-up. A Body Shape Index (ABSI) showed the strongest association with all-cause mortality, with an AUC of 0.67. Participants with ABSI ≥0.082 had a significantly higher risk of death (HR: 1.87, 95%CI: 1.31-2.68), as did those with depression (HR: 1.86, 95%CI: 1.19-2.92). Interaction analysis revealed a synergistic effect between depression and ABSI, increasing death risk by 293 % when both were present. Significant survival differences were observed between men and women with these risk factors, with median survival rates of 76.3 % and 90.8 %, respectively. The model based on ABSI and depression provided valuable mortality predictions, with AUC of 0.78, 0.77, and 0.77 for 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival. CONCLUSION: ABSI and depression are associated with all-cause mortality in individuals with low sexual frequency, potentially creating a synergistic effect on mortality risk.

10.1126/scitranslmed.adn5603	Interneuron-specific dual-AAV SCN1A gene replacement corrects epileptic phenotypes in mouse models of Dravet syndrome.	Mich JK, Ryu J, Wei AD, Gore BB, Guo R, Bard AM, Martinez RA, Luber EM, Liu J, Bishaw YM, Christian RJ, Oliveira LM, Miranda N, Ramirez JM, Ting JT, Lein ES, Levi BP, Kalume FK	Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe developmental epileptic encephalopathy marked by treatment-resistant seizures, developmental delay, intellectual disability, motor deficits, and a 10 to 20% rate of premature death. Most patients with DS harbor loss-of-function mutations in one copy of SCN1A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel (Na(V))1.1 alpha subunit and has been associated with inhibitory neuron dysfunction. Here, we generated a split-intein form of SCN1A and used a dual-vector delivery approach to circumvent adeno-associated virus (AAV) packaging limitations. In addition, we applied previously developed enhancer technology to produce an interneuron-specific gene replacement therapy for DS, called DLX2.0-SCN1A. The split-intein SCN1A vectors produced full-length Na(V)1.1 protein, and functional sodium channels were recorded in HEK293 cells in vitro. Administration of dual DLX2.0-SCN1A AAVs to wild-type mice produced full-length, reconstituted human protein by Western blot and telencephalic interneuron-specific and dose-dependent Na(V)1.1 expression by immunohistochemistry. These vectors also conferred strong dose-dependent protection against postnatal mortality and seizures in Scn1a(fl/+);Meox2-Cre and Scn1a(+/R613X) DS mouse models. Injection of single or dual DLX2.0-SCN1A AAVs into wild-type mice did not result in increased mortality, weight loss, or gliosis as measured by immunohistochemistry. In contrast, expression of SCN1A in all neurons driven by the human SYNAPSIN I promoter caused an adverse effect marked by increased mortality in the preweaning period, before disease onset. These findings demonstrate proof of concept that interneuron-specific AAV-mediated SCN1A gene replacement can rescue DS phenotypes in mouse models and suggest that it could be a therapeutic approach for patients with DS.

No therapy is available for the condition except for a lifelong gluten-free diet. To address this gap, we explored the therapeutic potential of regulatory T cells (T(regs)). By orthotopic replacement of T cell receptors (TCRs) through homology-directed repair, we generated gluten-reactive HLA-DQ2.5-restricted CD4(+) engineered (e) T effector cells (T(effs)) and eT(regs) and performed in vivo experiments in HLA-DQ2.5 transgenic mice. Of five validated TCRs, TCRs specific for two immunodominant and deamidated gluten epitopes (DQ2.5-glia-α1a and DQ2.5-glia-α2) were selected for further evaluation. CD4(+) eT(effs) exposed to deamidated gluten through oral gavage colocalized with dendritic and B cells in the Peyer's patches and gut-draining lymph nodes and specifically migrated to the intestine. The suppressive function of human eT(regs) correlated with high TCR functional activity. eT(regs) specific for one epitope suppressed the proliferation and gut migration of CD4(+) eT(effs) specific for the same and the other gluten epitope, demonstrating bystander suppression. The suppression requires an antigen-specific activation of eT(regs) given that polyclonal T(regs) failed to suppress CD4(+) eT(effs). These findings highlight the potential of gluten-reactive eT(regs) as a therapeutic for celiac disease.

10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.124.24277	Identification of Novel Therapeutic Targets for Hypertension.	Zheng Z, Chen R, Liu M, Ding Y, Xu S, Hou C, Li S	BACKGROUND: Persistently high blood pressure remains the leading risk factor for mortality worldwide. This study aims to identify potential drug targets for hypertension. METHODS: Mendelian randomization was used to identify therapeutic targets for hypertension. Genome-wide association study summary statistics were obtained from the UK Biobank and FinnGen study. Cis-expression quantitative trait loci from the eQTLGen Consortium served as genetic instruments. Colocalization analysis evaluated the likelihood of shared causal variants between single-nucleotide polymorphisms influencing hypertension and gene expression. Survival analysis of UK Biobank data assessed hypertension and mortality risks across participants with different gene alleles. RESULTS: Mendelian randomization analysis identified 190 drug targets in the discovery cohort and 65 in the replication cohort after multiple testing correction. Colocalization analysis identified 14 hypertension-related drug targets, including angiotensin-converting enzyme, AIMP1, CDC25A, EHMT2, FES, GPX1, GRK4, HSD3B7, NEK4, PTPN12, SIK2, SLC22A4, SLC2A4, and TNFSF12. Survival analysis revealed individuals with the A allele at rs4308 in the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene had a higher incidence of hypertension, while those with the T allele at rs11242109 in the SLC22A4 gene showed a lower hypertension-specific mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Drug target Mendelian randomization studies offer new directions for hypertension treatment, providing insights into its mechanisms and robust targets for developing antihypertensive drugs.

10.1007/s11357-025-01584-y	Age-related alterations of angiogenesis, inflammation and bone microarchitecture during fracture healing in mice.	Menger MM, Manuschewski R, Hans S, Braun BJ, Kayali MKDE, Ehnert S, Ampofo E, Wrublewsky S, Menger MD, Histing T, Laschke MW	The surgical treatment of geriatric patients represents a major challenge in traumatology. It is well known that aging affects fracture healing. However, the exact pathophysiology of age-related changes in angiogenesis, inflammation and bone remodeling remains still elusive. Therefore, we herein studied the differences of femoral fracture healing in young adult (3-4 months) and aged (16-18 months) CD-1 mice by using a stable closed femoral fracture model with intramedullary screw fixation. The callus tissue was analyzed by means of X-ray, micro-computed tomography (µCT), histology and immunohistochemistry. We found a deteriorated trabecular architecture and a reduced bone formation within the callus tissue of aged mice. Moreover, aged animals showed an increased number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts at an early healing time point, whereas the fraction of mature α-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive microvessels was significantly reduced. Furthermore, the numbers of macrophages and granulocytes were higher in the callus tissue of aged animals at the end of the healing process. Taken together, these results demonstrate a delayed femoral fracture healing in aged CD-1 mice. This is most likely caused by an early overshooting osteoclast response, a decelerated maturation of the callus microvasculature and a late increased recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells. Targeting these alterations may contribute to the development of novel treatment approaches for the stimulation of bone regeneration in geriatric patients.

The callus tissue was analyzed by means of X-ray, micro-computed tomography (µCT), histology and immunohistochemistry. We found a deteriorated trabecular architecture and a reduced bone formation within the callus tissue of aged mice. Moreover, aged animals showed an increased number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts at an early healing time point, whereas the fraction of mature α-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive microvessels was significantly reduced. Furthermore, the numbers of macrophages and granulocytes were higher in the callus tissue of aged animals at the end of the healing process. Taken together, these results demonstrate a delayed femoral fracture healing in aged CD-1 mice. This is most likely caused by an early overshooting osteoclast response, a decelerated maturation of the callus microvasculature and a late increased recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells. Targeting these alterations may contribute to the development of novel treatment approaches for the stimulation of bone regeneration in geriatric patients.	age relate alteration angiogenesis inflammation bone microarchitecture fracture healing mouse surgical treatment geriatric patient represent major challenge traumatology be well know age affect fracture healing however exact pathophysiology age relate change angiogenesis inflammation bone remodeling remain still elusive therefore herein study difference femoral fracture healing young adult 3 4 month age 16 18 month CD-1 mouse use stable closed femoral fracture model intramedullary screw fixation callus tissue be analyze mean x ray micro computed tomography µct histology immunohistochemistry find deteriorated trabecular architecture reduce bone formation callus tissue aged mouse moreover aged animal show increase number tartrate resistant acid phosphatase trap)-positive osteoclast early healing time point fraction mature α smooth muscle actin sma)-positive microvessel be significantly reduce furthermore number macrophage granulocyte be high callus tissue aged animal end healing process take together result demonstrate delay femoral fracture healing aged CD-1 mouse be most likely cause early overshoot osteoclast response decelerate maturation callus microvasculature late increase recruitment pro inflammatory cell target alteration may contribute development novel treatment approach stimulation bone regeneration geriatric patient

Liu YT, Liu HM, Ren JG, Zhang W, Wang XX, Yu ZL, Fu QY, Xiong XP, Jia J, Liu B, Chen G	Tumor stromal cells (TSCs) play a crucial yet underexplored role in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This study uses single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics on paired tumor specimens from 22 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) enrolled in a randomized two-arm phase 2 trial, receiving neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 mono-immunotherapy or anti-PD-1 plus docetaxel-cisplatin-5-fluorouracil (TPF) immunochemotherapy. Single-cell analysis reveals increased TSCs within the TME of responders in immunochemotherapy. Notably, significant post-treatment upregulation of SELP(+) high endothelial venules (HEVs) and APOD(+) myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs), alongside a decline in STMN1(+) capillary endothelial cells (cECs), is specific to the immunochemotherapy cohort. In contrast, MYF5(+) muscle satellite cells (MSCs) are upregulated in non-responders to mono-immunotherapy. SELP(+) HEVs and APOD(+) myCAFs foster favorable immunomodulatory stromal niches for improved outcomes, while STMN1(+) cECs and MYF5(+) MSCs form immunosuppressive niches in tumor invasion regions, highlighting therapeutic targets. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, and the registration number is NCT04649476.	Cell reports.

Kanbay M, Ozbek L, Guldan M, Abdel-Rahman SM, Narin AE, Ortiz A	The rapid increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has become a significant global public health concern. UPFs are typically high in unhealthy fats, refined sugars, sodium, and other additives while being low in proteins, fibers, and other essential nutrients. Their high glycemic index and glycemic load lead to blood sugar spikes, contributing to metabolic dysregulation. Emerging evidence links UPF intake to the development of the cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome and a higher risk of adverse health outcomes, such as all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The pathophysiological mechanisms likely involve chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, dysregulated lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, immune dysfunction, and gut microbiota disruption. The adverse effects are even more concerning in vulnerable populations, including individuals with chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, and the elderly. This review article explores how UPF intake contributes to chronic diseases across the CKM spectrum, including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, while also exacerbating frailty and reducing quality of life. The focus goes beyond risks of individual metabolic complications to address the broader health implications of UPFs on the increased prevalence of multiple coexistent non-communicable diseases, frailty, reduced quality of life, meta-inflammation, metabolic memory, and syndemics, which are particularly critical for the aging geriatric population.

Oliver A, Arca-Suárez J, Gomis-Font MA, González-Pinto L, López-Causapé C	BACKGROUND: While the introduction of novel β-lactams and/or combinations with β-lactamase inhibitors over the last decade is helping to mitigate the threat of extensively drug-resistant (XDR)/difficult to treat resistant (DTR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, the problem is far from being solved, due to the capacity of this pathogen for developing resistance. OBJECTIVES: To provide a comprehensive analysis of the emerging/evolving resistance mechanisms to the antipseudomonal β-lactams introduced over the last decade. SOURCES: Literature review of published studies before December 31(st) 2024 analyzing P. aeruginosa resistance mechanisms for ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftazidime/avibactam, cefiderocol, imipenem/relebactam, meropenem/vaborbactam and/aztreonam/avibactam. CONTENT: Among the emerging resistance mechanisms are noteworthy the mutations in the catalytic centers (mostly the Ω-loop) of AmpC, the horizontally acquired OXA-2/OXA-10 enzymes or of the class A carbapenemases (GES/KPC). These mutations typically confer ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibacm resistance. They also frequently increase cefiderocol MICs, and some of them, such as the L320P AmpC mutation, affect cefiderocol specifically. However, most of these mutations confer collateral susceptibility to carbapenems. Efflux pumps are also relevant, given their capacity to extrude both, the β-lactam and their partner β-lactamase inhibitor. Moreover, beyond the classical mutational overexpression of efflux pumps, emerging resistance is driven by the selection of structural mutations leading to modified (enhanced) substrate recognition. Other emerging mechanisms include β-lactam target mutations (particularly PBP3), large genomic deletions, the activation of two-component regulators (such as ParRS or CpxRS) or the mutations in iron transport systems (such as Piu or Pir) involved in cefiderocol resistance. IMPLICATIONS: A deep understanding of emerging resistance mechanisms, including their conferred cross resistances and collateral susceptibilities, should be useful for the optimization of treatments of severe XDR/DTR P. aeruginosa infections.

Mao L, Lu J, Yang Q, Liu Z, Wu C, Ke B, Su K, Yuan H, Cui Y, Wang Y, Salvi R, Yang G, Yin S, Liu F, Li C	Bilirubin, an endogenous metabolite with many significant physiological roles, particularly anti-inflammatory properties, shows great promise as a treatment for inflammatory diseases. However, the binding targets and downstream signaling mechanisms of bilirubin remain unclear. Here, by using quantitative phosphorylation proteomics and several powerful chemical biology techniques such as the Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA), molecular docking, and MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST), it is identified and confirmed that with-no-lysine (K) kinase 1 (WNK1) is the primary target of bilirubin at physiological concentrations. Bilirubin binds to the kinase domain of WNK1, activating its kinase activity and increasing the intracellular chloride ion concentration via the downstream SPAK/OSR1-KCC2 pathway in neurons. Manipulating endogenous bilirubin levels by deleting Blvra, the bilirubin synthesis enzyme, and Ugt1a1, its metabolic enzyme, significantly promotes and inhibits the activation of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome, respectively, in mouse hippocampus. Similarly, exogenous bilirubin supplementation suppressed LPS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in mouse hippocampus in a WNK1-dependent manner. Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of WNK1 downstream signaling elucidated the broad biological roles of WNK1, notably its function in suppressing inflammation. The findings clarify the direct targets and signaling mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of bilirubin and pave the way for exploring its novel functions.

Chen XX, Lu FY, Wang Y, Zhang L, Li SQ, Lin YN, Yan YR, Ding YJ, Li N, Zhou JP, Sun XW, Li QY	BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence on the causal associations of life-course adiposity with the risk of respiratory diseases. This study aimed to elucidate these associations. METHODS: Two-sample Mendelian randomization was conducted using genetic instruments of life-course adiposity (including birth weight, childhood BMI, and adulthood adiposity) to estimate their causal effect on respiratory diseases in participants of European ancestry from the UK Biobank, the FinnGen consortium, and other large consortia. RESULTS: Genetically predicted higher birth weight was associated with decreased risk of acute upper respiratory infections and increased risk of pulmonary embolism, sleep apnea, and lung cancer. Genetically predicted high childhood BMI was associated with increased risk of asthma, COPD, pulmonary embolism, and sleep apnea. However, most of these observed associations were no longer significant after adjusting for adult BMI. Genetically predicted higher adult BMI and WHR were associated with 10 and 4 respiratory diseases, respectively. High adult body fat percentage and visceral adiposity were genetically associated with increased risk of 9 and 11 respiratory diseases, respectively. Consistently, genetically predicted higher whole-body fat mass was associated with increased risk of 8 respiratory diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides genetic evidence that greater adiposity in childhood and adulthood has a causal effect in increasing the risk of a wide range of respiratory diseases. Furthermore, the effects of childhood obesity on respiratory outcomes may be mediated by adult obesity.

Accurate POPF risk prediction could help. Two independent preoperative prediction models have been developed and externally validated: DISPAIR and D-FRS. The aim of this study was to validate, compare, and possibly update the models. METHODS: Patients from nine high-volume pancreatic surgery centres (8 in Europe and 1 in North America) were included in this retrospective cohort study. Inclusion criteria were age over 18 years and open or minimally invasive left pancreatectomy since 2010. Model performance was assessed with discrimination (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves) and calibration (calibration plots). The updated model was developed with logistic regression and internally-externally validated. RESULTS: Of 2284 patients included, 497 (21.8%) developed POPF. Both DISPAIR (area under the ROC curve (AUC) 0.62) and D-FRS (AUC 0.62) performed suboptimally, both in the pooled validation cohort combining every centre's data and centre-wise. An updated model, named DISPAIR-FRS, was constructed by combining the most stable predictors from the existing models and incorporating other readily available patient demographics, such as age, sex, transection site, pancreatic thickness at the transection site, and main pancreatic duct diameter at the transection site. Internal-external validation demonstrated an AUC of 0.72, a calibration slope of 0.93, and an intercept of -0.02 for the updated model.

CONCLUSION: The combined updated model of DISPAIR and D-FRS named DISPAIR-FRS demonstrated better performance and can be accessed at www.tinyurl.com/the-dispair-frs.	international multicentre validation left pancreatectomy pancreatic fistula prediction model development validation combine dispair frs prediction model background fifth patient undergo left pancreatectomy develop postoperative pancreatic fistula popf accurate popf risk prediction could help two independent preoperative prediction model have be develop externally validate dispair d frs aim study be to validate compare possibly update model method patient nine high volume pancreatic surgery centre 8 europe 1 north america be include retrospective cohort study inclusion criterion be age 18 year open minimally invasive left pancreatectomy 2010 model performance be assess discrimination receiver operating characteristic roc curve calibration calibration plot update model be develop logistic regression internally externally validate result 2284 patient include 497 21.8 develop popf dispair area roc curve auc 0.62 d frs auc 0.62 perform suboptimally pool validation cohort combine centre 's datum centre wise update model name dispair frs be construct combine most stable predictor exist model incorporate other readily available patient demographic such age sex transection site pancreatic thickness transection site main pancreatic duct diameter transection site internal external validation demonstrate auc 0.72 calibration slope 0.93 intercept -0.02 update model conclusion combine update model dispair d frs name dispair frs demonstrate well performance can be access www.tinyurl.com/the-dispair-frs
10.1038/s41467-025-57131-y	Accessible homeostatic gastric organoids reveal secondary cell type-specific host-pathogen interactions in Helicobacter pylori infections.	Hofer M, Kim Y, Broguiere N, Gorostidi F, Klein JA, Amieva MR, Lutolf MP	Despite the high prevalence of gastric diseases like gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease attributed to Helicobacter pylori infections, there is still only a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Existing in vitro models are either two-dimensional systems lacking the structural complexity of the gastric architecture, or complex three-dimensional systems that pose challenges for experimental access. In this study, we introduce a patterned homeostatic human gastric organoid-on-a-chip system with bilateral access that is capable of modeling H. pylori niche establishment and persistent colonization of the gastric epithelium. We show that in physiological apical acidic conditions, our organ-on-a-chip can generate pit cells of higher maturity in contrast to traditionally grown organoids. Upon infection with H. pylori for up to 6 days, these mature pit cells exhibit a distinctive response from other cell types, which was previously uncharacterized. Beyond its application in studying H. pylori infection, the increased structural and functional relevance of our model offers broader significance as a versatile platform for advancing our understanding of gastric epithelial cell interactions, gastric mucosal immunity, and host-pathogen interactions.

10.1084/jem.58.4.415	STUDIES ON PSEUDORABIES (INFECTIOUS BULBAR PARALYSIS, MAD ITCH) : I.	Hurst EW	The histology of pseudorabies differs materially in various animal species. In the rabbit, subcutaneous, intradermal or intramuscular inoculation leads to local inflammation and necrosis. The infection ascends the peripheral nerve (possibly both interstitially and by the axis-cylinders) to the corresponding spinal ganglia and segments of the spinal cord, where primary degeneration of nerve and glial cells takes place. The nerve cell changes are probably responsible for the cardinal symptom of the disease, itching. Death ensues soon after virus reaches the medulla, before visible changes have been produced here. Intracerebral inoculation is followed by characteristic lesions in the meninges, in subpial glial cells and in superficially placed nerve cells. Morbid changes in the lungs are not necessarily related to the presence of virus, but specific lesions may be present. Intranuclear inclusions bearing some resemblance to those in herpetic encephalitis, yellow fever, etc., occur in cells derived from all embryonic layers. The disease in the guinea pig resembles closely that in the rabbit and is modified only by the slightly greater resistance of the animal. In the monkey after intracerebral inoculation, widespread degeneration and necrosis of cortical nerve cells are accompanied by the appearance of specific nuclear alterations in nerve and glial cells, but not in cells of mesodermal origin. No lesions are found in other viscera. In the spontaneous disease in the cow lesions approximate more closely to those in the monkey than to those in the rabbit. In the pig vascular and interstitial lesions predominate, nerve cell degeneration is relatively slight and typical inclusions are not observed. These differences probably explain the benign course of the malady following subcutaneous inoculation in this animal. The lymphatic system, too, participates in the reaction to the virus.
